	abstract = {Past research suggests that social anxiety is associated with increased processing of cardiac activity. Cognitive theories propose that this is one aspect of self-focus, which is driven by concerns that features of the self, such as anxiety symptoms, will elicit evaluation from others. We investigated the relationship of social anxiety to the cortical processing of heartbeats as reﬂected in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) during false feedback of accelerated heart rate. Thirty-eight participants with high social anxiety (HSA; n = 19) and non-elevated social anxiety (NSA; n = 19) completed a cognitive task during which false feedback of accelerated heart rate was randomly provided on 50\% of trials. HEP amplitude was larger in HSAs, but not NSAs, during false heartbeat acceleration cues compared to standard cues. HEP amplitude also was larger in HSAs compared to NSAs during acceleration cues. HEP amplitude during acceleration cues, but not standard cues correlated with social anxiety. Within the ﬁrst second after the R-peak, social anxiety correlated with voltage at Fz from 223 to 305 ms. Social concerns about the consequences of anxiety symptoms accounted for an indirect relationship between social anxiety and the HEP. These data extend prior evidence of increased processing of cardiac activity in socially anxious individuals, providing support for cognitive theories.},

	abstract = {Unconsciousness in severe acquired brain injury (sABI) patients occurs with different cognitive and neural profiles. Perturbational approaches, which enable the estimation of proxies for brain reorganization, have added a new avenue for investigating the non-behavioural diagnosis of consciousness. In this prospective observational study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the topological patterns of heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP) between patients experiencing a prolonged disorder of consciousness (pDoC) and patients emerging from a minimally consciousness state (eMCS). A total of 219 sABI patients were enrolled, each undergoing a synchronous EEG-ECG resting-state recording, together with a standardized consciousness diagnosis. A number of graph metrics were computed before/after the HEP (Before/After) using the R-peak on the ECG signal. The peak value of the global field power of the HEP was found to be significantly higher in eMCS patients with no difference in latency. Power spectrum was not able to discriminate consciousness neither Before nor After. Node assortativity and global efficiency were found to vary with different trends at unconsciousness. Lastly, the Perturbational Complexity Index of the HEP was found to be significantly higher in eMCS patients compared with pDoC. Given that cortical elaboration of peripheral inputs may serve as a non-behavioural determinant of consciousness, we have devised a low-cost and translatable technique capable of estimating causal proxies of brain functionality with an endogenous, non-invasive stimulus. Thus, we present an effective means to enhance consciousness assessment by incorporating the interaction between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and central nervous system (CNS) into the loop.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that time estimation relies on bodily rhythms and interoceptive signals. We provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence suggesting an association between the brain's processing of heartbeat and duration judgment. We examined heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and contingent negative variation (CNV) during an auditory duration-reproduction task and a control reaction-time task spanning 4, 8, and 12 s intervals, in both male and female participants. Interoceptive awareness was assessed with the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ) and interoceptive accuracy through the heartbeat-counting task (HCT). Results revealed that SAQ scores, but not the HCT, correlated with mean reproduced durations with higher SAQ scores associating with longer and more accurate duration reproductions. Notably, the HEP amplitude changes during the encoding phase of the timing task, particularly within 130–270 ms (HEP1) and 470–520 ms (HEP2) after the R -peak, demonstrated interval-specific modulations that did not emerge in the control task. A significant ramp-like increase in HEP2 amplitudes occurred during the duration-encoding phase of the timing but not during the control task. This increase within the reproduction phase of the timing task correlated significantly with the reproduced durations for the 8 s and the 4 s intervals. The larger the increase in HEP2, the greater the under-reproduction of the estimated duration. CNV components during the encoding phase of the timing task were more negative than those in the reaction-time task, suggesting greater executive resources orientation toward time. We conclude that interoceptive awareness (SAQ) and cortical responses to heartbeats (HEP) predict duration reproductions, emphasizing the embodied nature of time.},

However, no study has assessed the convergence between interoception and time estimation using behavioral, neurophysiological, and functional anatomy signatures. We examined the multimodal convergence between interoception and time estimation using a twofold approach. In study 1, we developed a dual design combining interoception (measuring heartbeat detection HBD, and heartbeat evoked potential - HEP) with a time estimation paradigm (TEP, estimation of duration of a 120 s interval). In study 2, we performed a conjoint metanalysis (Multi-level Kernel Density Analysis, MKDA) of neuroimaging, including reports of interoception and time estimation. Both studies provide convergent evidence of time estimation’s significant involvement in behavioral, electrophysiological (enhanced HEP), and neuroimaging (overlapping cluster in the right insula and operculum) signatures of interoception. Convergent results from both studies offer direct support for a shared mechanism of interoception and time estimation.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research studies have demonstrated that impaired interoception is involved in emotional information processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). Heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes, an index for interoception, could be manipulated by emotional faces in healthy people. Considering negative emotional bias is the core characteristic in MDD, we hypothesized that interoception dysfunction was associated with the negative emotional bias in MDD. Methods: An electroencephalogram (EEG) study under an emotional faces task was applied to explore the relationship between interoception and emotional bias. HEPs before emotional faces stimuli were used to predict the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes and it worked as an index of emotional bias. Twenty-seven patients with MDD and 27 healthy controls (HCs) participated in this study. Source analysis gave an auxiliary description for results in sensory level. Results: Major depressive disorders (MDDs) had poor performance in the heartbeat count task (HCT) and attenuate HEP average amplitudes (455–550 ms). Compared with HCs, cluster-based permutation t-tests revealed that MDDs had attenuated LPP amplitudes (300–1,000 ms) over centroparietal regions and enhanced LPP amplitudes over frontocentral regions. Furthermore, abnormal attenuated HEPs could predict aberrant LPPs under sad face stimuli in MDDs, which could be associated with the dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right insula. Conclusion: Mediated by ACC and insula, interoception dysfunction contributes to the negative emotional bias of MDD, highlighting the importance of interoception in the disorder.},

	abstract = {Central nervous systems receive and process information from the internal and external environment to maintain homeostasis. This includes interoceptive awareness of the organism’s nutritional state. Whenever food supply is required, feelings of hunger initiate the search for and the consumption of appropriate amounts of nutrients. How this is physiologically regulated in humans has been subjected to research into interoceptive awareness of body states during fasting and food consumption. However, there is no research on the distinct effects of carbohydrate or protein intake on interoception. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of fasting and consumption of standardized carbohydrate and protein shakes on interoception in a repeatedmeasures cross-over design in a sample of 37 healthy, normal weight males. As a physiological correlate of interoception, we measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), which are suggested to reﬂect the cortical representation of cardiac signals, during eight-minutes resting state EEG-recordings. After a 16-hour fasting period, the HEP amplitudes were lower over right central and parietal electrodes and increased after ingestion of the nutritional shake. Exploratory analyses indicated that the difference between fasting and satiety was more prominent at carbohydrate compared protein testing days. Correlation analyses with heart rate variability (HRV) suggested that high cardiac sympathetic activity is related to lower HEP amplitudes. Furthermore, cardiac sympathetic activity and stress indices decreased from before to after the intervention, whereas HRV increased. Together, this study shows for the ﬁrst time that fasting and the intake of a nutritional shake affects cardiac measures of autonomic nervous system functioning and the neural correlates of cardiac interoception. These ﬁndings could be relevant for diets and psychosomatic disorders, including eating disorders.},

Even though theoretical accounts suggest an important role for interoception in the development of the self, empirical investigations are limited, particularly in infancy. Previous studies used preferential-looking paradigms to assess the detection of sensorimotor and multisensory contingencies in infancy, usually related to proprioception and touch. So far, only one recent study reported that infants discriminated between audiovisual stimuli presented synchronously or asynchronously with their heartbeat. This discrimination was related to the amplitude of the infant's heartbeat evoked potentials (HEP), a neural correlate of interoception. In the current study, we measured looking preferences between synchronous and asynchronous visuocardiac (bimodal), and audiovisuocardiac (trimodal) stimuli as well as the HEP in conditions of different emotional contexts and with different degrees of self-relatedness in a mirror-like setup. While the infants preferred trimodal to bimodal stimuli, we did not observe the predicted differences between synchronous and asynchronous stimulation. Furthermore, the HEP was not modulated by emotional context or self-relatedness. These findings do not support previously published results and highlight the need for further studies on the early development of interoception in relation to the development of the self.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests that brain-heart interactions are associated with perceptual and self-consciousness. In this line, the neural responses to visceral inputs have been hypothesized to play a leading role in shaping our subjective experience. This study aims to investigate whether the contextual processing of auditory irregularities modulates both direct neuronal responses to the auditory stimuli (ERPs) and the neural responses to heartbeats, as measured with heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs). HERs were computed in patients with disorders of consciousness, diagnosed with a minimally conscious state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. We tested whether HERs reflect conscious auditory perception, which can potentially provide additional information for the consciousness diagnosis. EEG recordings were taken during the local-global paradigm, which evaluates the capacity of a patient to detect the appearance of auditory irregularities at local (short-term) and global (long-term) levels. The results show that local and global effects produce distinct ERPs and HERs, which can help distinguish between the minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Furthermore, we found that ERP and HER responses were not correlated suggesting that independent neuronal mechanisms are behind them. These findings suggest that HER modulations in response to auditory irregularities, especially local irregularities, may be used as a novel neural marker of consciousness and may aid in the bedside diagnosis of disorders of consciousness with a more cost-effective option than neuroimaging methods.},

In this framework, attention is thought to gate the inﬂuence of sensory information on perception. In contrast to exteroception, there is limited evidence for purely attentional effects on interoception. Here, we empirically tested if attentional focus modulates cortical processing of single heartbeats, using a newly-developed experimental paradigm to probe purely attentional differences between exteroceptive and interoceptive conditions in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) using EEG recordings. We found that the HEP is signiﬁcantly higher during interoceptive compared to exteroceptive attention, in a time window of 524–620 ms after the R-peak. Furthermore, this effect predicted self-report measures of autonomic system reactivity. Our study thus provides direct evidence that the HEP is modulated by pure attention and suggests that this effect may provide a clinically relevant readout for assessing interoception.},

On both days, heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) and cardiac and autonomic nervous system activation indices (heart rate, normalized low frequency heart rate variability [nLF HRV]) were assessed. The HEP is an EEG pattern that is considered an index of cortical representation of afferent cardiovascular signals. Average HEP activity (R wave +455–595 ms) was enhanced during food deprivation compared to normal food intake. Cardiac activation did not differ between nutritional conditions. Our results indicate that short-term food deprivation ampliﬁes an electrophysiological correlate of the cortical representation of visceral-afferent signals originating from the cardiovascular system.

	abstract = {The self has been proposed to be rooted in the neural monitoring of internal bodily signals and might thus involve interoceptive areas, notably the right anterior insula (rAI). However, studies on the self consistently showed the involvement of midline default network (DN) nodes, without referring to visceral monitoring. Here, we investigate this apparent discrepancy. We previously showed that neural responses to heartbeats in the DN encode two different self-dimensions, the agentive ‘I’ and the introspective ‘Me’, in a whole-brain analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Here, we confirm and anatomically refine this result with intracranial recordings (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG). In two patients, we show a parametric modulation of neural responses to heartbeats by the self-relatedness of thoughts, at the single trial level. A region-of-interest analysis of the insula reveals that MEG responses to heartbeats in the rAI encode the ‘I’ self-dimension. The effect in rAI was weaker than in the DN and was replicated in iEEG data in one patient out of two. We propose that a common mechanism, the neural monitoring of cardiac signals, underlies the self in both the DN and rAI. This might reconcile studies on the self highlighting the DN, with studies on interoception focusing on the insula.

	abstract = {Objectives: Neurotransmission from the heart to the brain results in a heartbeat evoked potential (HEP). This potential appears as a positive waveform ranging from 250 to 600 ms after the onset of ventricular contraction. Only limited information exists as to what extent the HEP is sensitive to a dysfunction in cardio-afferent pathways. Thus, the HEP was studied in patients with autonomic diabetic neuropathy. Methods: Twenty-Æve patients and a healthy control group of equal size participated. The HEP was obtained as the average over 1200 EEG sweeps (18 channels) sampled contingent upon the onset of ventricular contraction. A heartbeat attention task and a distraction task were employed. Patients answered a questionnaire pertaining to the frequency of subjective symptoms related to diabetic neuropathy. Results: The HEP amplitude at frontal, central and temporal locations was signiÆcantly diminished in patients in the latency range of 280± 330 ms. A signiÆcant correlation was found between the questionnaire score of subjective autonomic symptoms and the reduction in the HEP. Conclusions: We conclude that the HEP is sensitive to a comparably moderate abnormality in nerve function. Furthermore, we assume that the processing of subjective symptoms of the disease and the generation of the HEP share some common neuronal pathways. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {The study of heart action-related brain potentials is strongly disrupted by the presence of an inherent cardiac electric artifact. The hypothesis is presented that most of the electric current coupled to the cardiac field surrounds the skull and flows through the scalp tissue without crossing the cranial cavity. This pseudo two-dimensional conduction model contrasts with the volumetric conduction of the brain electrical activity, and this property is exploited to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. QRS loop vectorcardiographic projections on saggital planes were recorded in 11 healthy subjects in the head and neck areas. Comparative analysis of the projection eccentricities, estimated by the correlation coefficients of the paired data on each area, supported the hypothesis and allowed the handling of the cardiac electric field at the scalp as if enclosed in a two-dimensional wrapped space. This approach permitted the combination of different heart action-related brain potentials recorded at different electrode positions to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. The cancellation method, applied to the subjects" EEG data, yielded a slow cortical potential with a negligible cardiac electric residue and an amplitude of about 1.5-2 ixV, with a m a x i m u m around 150 ms and a minimum at 400 ms post-R wave.},

	abstract = {The electrical field of the heart propagates throughout the entire body and causes changes in the surface potentials on the scalp that are superimposed on brain electric signals. When heart cycle-related EEG averaging is performed, e.g. in order to measure heart cyclerelated brain potentials, the effects of the cardiac electrical field result in a high-amplitude artifact in the surface potentials. The topographic and temporal distributions of the cardiac field artifact were measured in 9 normal subjects. In addition, the effects of head-turning on the field were investigated. The electrocardiac artifact is most prominent during the QRS complex and during the T wave of the heart cycle. In both cases it is distinctly asymmetrical in relation to the hemispheres. A comparison of the scalp potentials and a computed vector ECG showed the 3-dimensional nature of the artifact. Non-computational strategies for the handling of the ECG artifact are discussed. A proper separation of the effects of the cardiac electrical field from heart cycle-related brain potentials is a prerequisite for the study of heart cycle-coordinated brain potentials. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Previous work exploring the interplay between the processing of internal bodily signals and the perception of external events suggests a correlative relationship between both domains. Here, we demonstrate an experimentally induced link between visual perception and the emotional modulation of interoceptive cardiac signals. We pair an emotion repetition-suppression paradigm shown to modulate neural responses to heartbeats with a previously reported visual detection task. Using electrophysiological and cardiac measurements, we show that, relative to alternating facial expressions of emotions, repeating facial expressions evoke stable patterns of cardiac responses and that this iteration of the cardiac response leads to a distinct modulation of the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitude. Crucially, we were able to modulate the direction of the amplitude change to increase HEP expression in response to repeated emotionally neutral faces and decrease it by repeating angry faces. Visual detection accuracy was significantly higher in repeating, relative to alternating face trials. Furthermore, reduced HEP amplitude to repeated angry faces acted as a direct predictor of subsequently elevated detection performance. Our findings demonstrate that accurate top-down anticipation of the heartbeat signal coincides with enhanced exteroceptive visual perception, particularly in the context of emotional events. Findings hereby highlight the integrated nature of internal and external stimulus processing and implicate predictive interoceptive processes induced by emotions for the conscious perception of sensory input activated from outside of the body.},

Utilizing heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs), we sought to determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) was related to the strength of the connection between the heart and brain. We also hypothesized that differing emotion states would result in differing amplitudes of HEPs. Participants were induced into emotional states with an autobiographical script of their happiest and saddest memory. HEPs were also recorded during diaphragmatic breathing at six breaths per minute. The evoked potentials during the emotional conditions, especially negative emotion were most attenuated. We believe that the signal from the heart to the brain may be ﬁltered by central limbic structures affecting the level of the signal at the cortex. It also appears that HRV affects the strength of HEPs, especially during resonant breathing. Signiﬁcant neurocardiac gender differences were also present across all conditions.

Although there are several neurophysiological findings supporting subjective emotional numbing, the psychobiology of disembodiment remains unclear. Methods: Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), which are considered psychophysiological indicators for the cortical representation of afferent signals originating from the cardiovascular system, were assessed in 23 patients with DPD and 24 healthy control individuals during rest and while performing a heartbeat perception task. Results: Absolute HEP amplitudes did not differ between groups. Nevertheless, healthy individuals showed higher HEPs during the heartbeat perception task than during rest, whereas no such effect was found in patients with DPD (p = .031). Patients with DPD had higher total levels of salivary α-amylase than did healthy individuals (9626.6 [8200.0] versus 5344.3 [3745.8] kU min/l; p = .029), but there were no group differences in cardiovascular measures (heart rate = 76.2 [10.1] versus 74.3 [7.5] beats/min, p = .60; normalized low-frequency heart rate variability = 0.63 [0.15] versus 0.56 [0.15] normalized units, p = .099; low frequency/high frequency ratio = 249.3 [242.7] versus 164.8 [108.8], p = .10), salivary cortisol (57.5 [46.7] versus 55.1 [43.6] nmol min/l, p = .86), or cortisone levels (593.2 [260.3] versus 543.8 [257.1] nmol min/l, p = .52). Conclusions: These results suggest altered cortical representation of afferent signals originating from the cardiovascular system in patients with DPD, which may be associated with higher sympathetic tone.

	abstract = {The processing and perception of individual internal bodily signals (interoception) has been differentiated to comprise different levels and processes involved. The so-called heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) offers an additional possibility to examine automatic processing of cardiac signals. Knowledge on neural structures potentially supporting different facets of interoception is still sparse. One way to get insights into neuroanatomical function is to manipulate the activity of different brain structures. In this study, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and a continuous theta-burst protocol to inhibit specific central locations of the interoceptive network including the right anterior insula and the right somatosensory cortices and assessed effects on interoceptive facets and the HEP in 18 male participants. Main results were that inhibiting anterior insula resulted in a significant decline in cardiac and respiratory interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and in a consistent decrease in perception confidence. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over somatosensory cortices reduced only cardiac IAc and affected perception confidence. Inhibiting right anterior insula and right somatosensory cortices increased interoceptive sensibility and reduced the HEP amplitude over frontocentral locations. Our findings strongly suggest that cTBS is an effective tool to investigate the neural network supporting interoceptive processes.

	abstract = {Interoception, the sensitivity to visceral sensations, plays an important role in homeostasis and guiding motivated behaviour. It is also considered to be fundamental to self-awareness. Despite its importance, the developmental origins of interoceptive sensitivity remain unexplored. We here provide the first evidence for implicit, flexible interoceptive sensitivity in 5 month old infants using a novel behavioural measure, coupled with an established cortical index of interoceptive processing. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early developmental stages of self-awareness, self-regulation and socio-emotional abilities. , From the beginning till the end of a person’s life, parts of the body continuously send signals to the brain. Most of this happens without the person even being aware of it, yet people can become aware of the signals under certain circumstances. For example, we can feel our racing heart rate or the “butterflies in our stomach” when we are anxious or excited. This ability to consciously sense signals from the body is called interoception, and some people are more aware of these signals than others. These differences between people can influence a wide range of psychological processes, including how strongly they feel emotions, how they make decisions, and their mental health. Despite the crucial role that interoception plays in thought processes in adults, scientists know practically nothing about how it first develops. Progress in this field has been hindered largely because there was no way to measure sensitivity to interoceptive signals in infants. Now, Maister et al. have developed a new task called iBEATS that can measure how sensitive an infant is to their own heartbeat. During the task, five-month old infants were shown an animated character that either moved in synchrony with their own heartbeat or out of synchrony with their heartbeat. The infants spent longer looking at the character that was moving out of synchrony than the one moving in synchrony, suggesting that even at this early age, infants can sense their own interoceptive signals. As with adults, some of the infants were more sensitive to their heartbeats than others, and Maister et al. could see these differences played out in the infant’s brain activity via electrodes placed on the infant’s head. Infants who had shown a strong preference in the iBEATS task also showed a larger brain signal known as the Heart-Evoked Potential (or HEP). Furthermore, this brain signal got larger when infants viewed a video clip of an angry or fearful face. This suggests that the infants’ brains were monitoring their hearts more closely when they were confronted with negative emotions. This study provides a validated measure of interoception for very young participants. Using this task, researchers can now investigate which factors affect how awareness to interoceptive signals develops, including social interactions and the infant’s temperament. Maister et al. also plan to carry out longer-term experiments to learn exactly how interoception may influence the development of emotional abilities, and also what role it might play in disorders such as anxiety and depression. The findings of these future experiments may eventually guide interventions to treat these conditions.},

This study tested three assumptions of the perception-filter model contributing to MUS: (I.) increased bodily signal strength (II.) decreased filter function, (III.) increased perception. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, trait MUS were assessed by a web-based survey (N = 486). The upper and lower decile were identified as extreme groups of high (HSR; n = 29; 26 women; Mage = 26.0 years) and low symptom reporters (LSR; n = 29; 21 women; Mage = 28.4 years). Mean heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), and cortisol awakening response (CAR) were assessed as indicators of bodily signal strength (I.). Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) were assessed during rest and a heartbeat perception task. HEPs reflect attentional resources allocated towards heartbeats and served as index of filter function (II.). Interoceptive accuracy (IAc) in heartbeat perception was assessed as an indicator of perception (III.). Results: HSR showed higher HR and lower HRV (RMSSD) than LSR (I.), but no differences in CAR. HSR exhibited a stronger increase of HEPs when attention was focused on heartbeats than LSR (II.); there were no group differences in IAc (III.). Conclusions: The perception-filter model was partially confirmed in that HSR showed altered bodily signals suggesting higher sympathetic activity (I.); higher HEP increases indicated increased filter function for bodily signals (II.). As more attentional resources are mobilized to process heartbeats, but perception accuracy remains unchanged (III.), this overflow could be responsible for detecting minor bodily changes associated with MUS.},

Patients were assessed longitudinally before surgery (T1), a few months later (T2) and a year after (T3). We assessed behavioural (heartbeat detection) and electrophysiological (heartbeat evoked potential) markers of interoception. Heartbeat detection task revealed that pre-surgery (T1) interoception was similar between patients and controls. However, patients were outperformed by controls after heart transplant (T2), but no such differences were observed in the follow-up analysis (T3). Neurophysiologically, although heartbeat evoked potential analyses revealed no differences between groups before the surgery (T1), reduced amplitudes of this event-related potential were found for the patients in the two post-transplant stages (T2, T3). All these significant effects persisted after covariation with different cardiological measures. In sum, this study brings new insights into the adaptive properties of brain–heart pathways.},

	abstract = {Recent frameworks in cognitive neuroscience and behavioral neurology underscore interoceptive priors as core modulators of negative emotions. However, the field lacks experimental designs manipulating the priming of emotions via interoception and exploring their multimodal signatures in neurodegenerative models. Here, we designed a novel task that involves interoceptive and control-exteroceptive priming conditions followed by post-interoception and post-exteroception facial emotion recognition (FER). We recruited 114 participants, including healthy controls (HCs) as well as patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We measured online EEG modulations of the heart-evoked potential (HEP), and associations with both brain structural and resting-state functional connectivity patterns. Behaviorally, post-interoception negative FER was enhanced in HCs but selectively disrupted in bvFTD and PD, with AD presenting generalized disruptions across emotion types. Only bvFTD presented impaired interoceptive accuracy. Increased HEP modulations during post-interoception negative FER was observed in HCs and AD, but not in bvFTD or PD patients. Across all groups, post-interoception negative FER correlated with the volume of the insula and the ACC. Also, negative FER was associated with functional connectivity along the (a) salience network in the post-interoception condition, and along the (b) executive network in the post-exteroception condition. These patterns were selectively disrupted in bvFTD (a) and PD (b), respectively. Our approach underscores the multidimensional impact of interoception on emotion, while revealing a specific pathophysiological marker of bvFTD. These findings inform a promising theoretical and clinical agenda in the fields of nteroception, emotion, allostasis, and neurodegeneration. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We examined whether and how emotions are primed by interoceptive states combining multimodal measures in healthy controls and neurodegenerative models. In controls, negative emotion recognition and ongoing HEP modulations were increased after interoception. These patterns were selectively disrupted in patients with atrophy across key interoceptive-emotional regions (e.g., the insula and the cingulate in frontotemporal dementia, frontostriatal networks in Parkinson's disease), whereas persons with Alzheimer's disease presented generalized emotional processing abnormalities with preserved interoceptive mechanisms. The integration of both domains was associated with the volume and connectivity (salience network) of canonical interoceptive-emotional hubs, critically involving the insula and the anterior cingulate. Our study reveals multimodal markers of interoceptive-emotional priming, laying the groundwork for new agendas in cognitive neuroscience and behavioral neurology.},

We present a novel biofeedback paradigm to explore the neurobehavioral consequences of three different types of engagement with cardiac interoception (Attend, Feel, Regulate) while participants perform a ‘cardiac recognition’ task. For both the Feel and Regulate conditions, participants displayed enhanced recognition of their own heartbeat, accompanied by larger heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), suggesting that these approaches could be used interchangeably. Importantly, meta-cognitive interoceptive insight was highest in the Regulate condition, indicative of stronger engagement with interoceptive signals in addition to greater ecological validity. Only in the passive interoception condition (Feel) was a significant association found between accuracy in recognising one’s own heartbeat and the amplitude of HEPs. Overall, our results imply that active conditions have an important role to play in future investigation of interoception.},

We used the heart-evoked potential (HEP), an index representing brain–heart interaction, as well as indices of peripheral physiology to assess the state of flow in individuals playing a video game. 22 gamers and 21 non-gamers played the video game Thumper for 25 min while their brain and cardiorespiratory signals were simultaneously recorded. The more participants were absorbed in the game, the less they thought about time and the faster time passed subjectively. On the cortical level, the fronto-central HEP amplitude was significantly lower while playing the game compared to resting states before and after the game, reflecting less self-referential processing while playing. This HEP effect corresponded with lower activity during gameplay in brain regions contributing to interoceptive processing. The HEP amplitude predicted the level of absorption in the game. While the HEP amplitude was overall lower during the gaming session than during the resting states, within the gaming session the amplitude of HEP was positively associated with absorption. Since higher absorption was related to higher performance in the game, the higher HEP in more absorbed individuals reflects more efficient brain–heart interaction, which is necessary for efficient game play. On the physiological level, a higher level of flow was associated with increased overall sympathetic activity and less inhibited parasympathetic activity toward the end of the game. These results are building blocks for future neurophysiological assessments of flow.},

	abstract = {Anticipating social stress evokes strong reactions in the organism, including interoceptive modulations. However, evidence for this claim comes from behavioral studies, often with inconsistent results, and relates almost solely to the reactive and recovery phase of social stress exposure. Here, we adopted an allostaticinteroceptive predictive coding framework to study interoceptive and exteroceptive anticipatory brain responses using a social rejection task. We analyzed the heartevoked potential (HEP) and task-related oscillatory activity of 58 adolescents via scalp EEG, and 385 human intracranial recordings of three patients with intractable epilepsy. We found that anticipatory interoceptive signals increased in the face of unexpected social outcomes, reﬂected in larger negative HEP modulations. Such signals emerged from key brain allostatic-interoceptive network hubs, as shown by intracranial recordings. Exteroceptive signals were characterized by early activity between 1-15 Hz across conditions, and modulated by the probabilistic anticipation of reward-related outcomes, observed over distributed brain regions. Our ﬁndings suggest that the anticipation of a social outcome is characterized by allostatic-interoceptive modulations that prepare the organism for possible rejection. These results inform our understanding of interoceptive processing and constrain neurobiological models of social stress.},

	abstract = {It has recently been suggested that predictive processing principles may apply to interoception, defined as the processing of hormonal, autonomic, visceral, and immunological signals. In the current study, we aimed at providing empirical evidence for the role of cardiac interoceptive prediction errors signals on allostatic adjustments, using transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) as a tool to modulate the processing of interoceptive afferents. In a within-subject design, participants performed a cardiac-related interoceptive task (heartbeat counting task) under taVNS and sham stimulation, spaced 1-week apart. We observed that taVNS, in contrast to sham stimulation, facilitated the maintenance of interoceptive accuracy levels over time (from the initial, stimulation-free, baseline block to subsequent stimulation blocks), suggesting that vagus nerve stimulation may have helped to maintain engagement to cardiac afferent signals. During the interoceptive task, taVNS compared to sham, produced higher heart-evoked potentials (HEP) amplitudes, a potential readout measure of cardiac-related prediction error processing. Further analyses revealed that the positive relation between interoceptive accuracy and allostatic adjustments—as measured by heart rate variability (HRV)—was mediated by HEP amplitudes. Providing initial support for predictive processing accounts of interoception, our results suggest that the stimulation of the vagus nerve may increase the precision with which interoceptive signals are processed, favoring their influence on allostatic adjustments.},

This study explores the relationship between neural correlates and subjective certainty of chord prediction, focusing on the alignment between predicted and actual chord progressions in both musically appropriate chord sequences and random chord sequences. Participants were asked to predict the final chord in sequences while their brain activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG). We found that the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN), an EEG component associated with predictive processing of sensory stimuli, was larger for non-harmonic chord sequences than for harmonic chord progressions. Additionally, the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an EEG component related to interoceptive processing, was larger for random chord sequences and correlated with prediction certainty ratings. HEP also correlated with the N5 component, found while listening to the final chord. Our findings suggest that HEP more directly reflects the subjective prediction certainty than SPN. These findings offer new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying music perception and prediction, emphasizing the importance of considering auditory prediction certainty when examining the neural basis of music cognition.},

However, it remains unclear whether repetitive engagement in physical exercise over time leads to long-term changes in cardiac interoceptive accuracy. It is also unknown whether those changes affect the neural activity associated with the processing of afferent cardiac signals, assessed by the heartevoked potential (HEP). In this study, we aimed to investigate this hypothesis through two cross-sectional studies, categorizing participants as active or inactive based on physical fitness (Study I; N = 45) or selfreported physical activity levels (Study II; N = 60). Interoception was assessed at rest using the HEP (Studies I and II), the Heartbeat Counting task (Study II), and the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) (Study II). Study I showed strong evidence of better cardiovascular fitness in the active group than in the inactive group as well as robust between-group differences in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Study 2 replicated the clear differences in ECG as a function of regular physical activity. Those results were expected due to clear differences in physical activity habits. In contrast, our analysis revealed no robust differences between groups across cardiac interoception tasks and the RHI, although the direct relevance of these measures to interoception remains under investigation. In sum, our results do not provide convincing evidence to support a strong version of the notion that regular physical exercise is associated with an enhanced in cardiac interoception.},

Here, we investigated auditory and cardio-audio regularity encoding during sleep, when bodily and environmental stimulus processing may be altered. Using electroencephalography and electrocardiography in healthy volunteers ( N = 26) during wakefulness and sleep, we measured the response to unexpected sound omissions within three regularity conditions: synchronous, where sound and heartbeat are temporally coupled, isochronous, with fixed sound-to-sound intervals, and a control condition without regularity. Cardio-audio regularity encoding manifested as a heartbeat deceleration upon omissions across vigilance states. The synchronous and isochronous sequences induced a modulation of the omission-evoked neural response in wakefulness and N2 sleep, the former accompanied by background oscillatory activity reorganization. The violation of cardio-audio and auditory regularity elicits cardiac and neural responses across vigilance states, laying the ground for similar investigations in altered consciousness states such as coma and anaesthesia.},

In this magnetoencephalography study of 32 healthy subjects of either sex, heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs), which reflect the cortical processing of heartbeats, were modulated by the perception of a sad face. The modulation effect was localized to the prefrontal cortices, the globus pallidus, and an interoceptive network including the right anterior insula (RAI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (RdACC). Importantly, our Granger causality analysis provides the first evidence for the increased flow of heartbeat information from the RAI to the RdACC during sad face perception. Moreover, using a surrogate R-peak analysis, we have shown that this HER modulation effect was time-locked to heartbeats. These findings advance the understanding of brain-body interactions during emotional processing.},

On the one hand, the external stimulus could modulate HERs. On the other hand, the HERs could aﬀect cognitive processing of the external stimulus. Whether the same neural mechanism underlies these two processes, however, remains unclear. Here, we investigated this interactive mechanism by measuring HERs using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and two name perception tasks. Speciﬁcally, we tested (1) how hearing a subject’s own name (SON) modulates HERs and (2) how the judgment of an SON is biased by prestimulus HERs. The results showed a dual interaction between HERs and SON. In particular, SON can modulate HERs for heartbeats occurring from 200 to 1200 ms after SON presentation. In addition, prestimulus HERs can bias the SON judgment when a stimulus is presented. Importantly, MEG activities from these two types of interactions diﬀered in spatial and temporal patterns, suggesting that they may be associated with distinct neural pathways. These ﬁndings extend our understanding of brain-heart interactions.},

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation is associated with dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, adverse cardiovascular events, cognitive and complex motor performance impairment. Less is known about the effects of acute total sleep deprivation (ATSD) on physiological coupling. We aimed to determine the effects of 24-h ATSD on the physiological coupling between complex subsystems by evaluating the cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular and cortico-cardiac interactions. This study enrolled 38 young healthy participants aged 23.2 ± 2.4 years. Multiple synchronous physiological signals including electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, bio-electrical impedance, electroencephalography, and continuous hemodynamic data, were performed over a baseline night after regular sleep and after a night with 24-h ATSD in the supine position. The magnitude squared coherence, phase synchronization index, and heartbeat evoked potential amplitudes, were obtained from 10-min synchronous physiological recordings to estimate the coupling strength between two time series. Parameters of hemodynamic characteristics and heart rate variability were also calculated to quantify autonomic regulation. Results indicated that the magnitude squared coherence (0.38 ± 0.17 vs. 0.29 ± 0.12, p = 0.015) between respiration and heart rate variability along with the magnitude squared coherence (0.36 ± 0.18 vs. 0.27 ± 0.13, p = 0.012) between respiration and pulse transit time were significantly decreased after 24-h ATSD. There were no significant differences (all p \&gt; 0.05) in phase synchronization indices, heartbeat evoked potential amplitudes as well as other analyzed measurements between baseline and 24-h ATSD states. We conclude that exposure to 24-h ATSD appears to weaken the cardiorespiratory and respiratory-cardiovascular coupling strength of young healthy adults. These findings suggest that physiological coupling analysis may serve as a complementary approach for characterizing and understanding the complex effects of sleep deprivation.},

Previous work suggests a relationship between this experience with the processing of affective and body states; however, no research has explored differences in interoception between people experiencing ASMR and those who do not. We hypothesized that the ASMR experience is based on interoception processing. To test this, we assessed group differences across different dimensions of interoception: Interoceptive sensibility (IS), measured using the multidimensional assessment of interoceptive awareness (MAIA); Interoceptive accuracy score (IAS), measured by calculating performance in a heartbeat counting task (HCT), and the electrophysiological index of interoception, the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), which was calculated during the HCT and an ASMR tingle reporting task (ASMR-TRT). Our results showed that IS and IAS, dimensions requiring conscious awareness, showed no differences between groups. However, HEP amplitude was larger in the ASMR group in both tasks. We concluded that the ASMR experience is based on an unconscious interoceptive mechanism, reflected by HEP, where exteroceptive social-affective stimuli are integrated to represent a body state of positive affective feelings and relaxation, as has been described for affective touch. The relevance of this finding relies on that interoceptive function, body regulation, and emotional/affective experiences are fundamental for wellbeing, and the relationship between ASMR and interoception opens the way to future research exploring the causal relationship between them and their potential clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Brain oscillations facilitate interaction within the brain network and between the brain and heart activities, and the alpha wave, as a prominent brain oscillation, plays a major role in these coherent activities. We hypothesize that mindfully breathing can make the brain and heart activities more coherent in terms of increased connectivity between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Eleven participants (28–52 years) attended 8 weeks of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training. EEG and ECG data of two states of mindful breathing and rest, both eye-closed, were recorded before and after the training. EEGLAB was used to analyze the alpha band (8–12 Hz) power, alpha peak frequency (APF), peak power and coherence. FMRIB toolbox was used to extract the ECG data. Heart coherence (HC) and heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) were calculated for further correlation analysis. Results: After 8 weeks of MBSR training, the correlation between APF and HC increased signiﬁcantly in the middle frontal region and bilateral temporal regions. The correlation between alpha coherence and heart coherence had similar changes, while alpha peak power did not reﬂect such changes. In contrast, spectrum analysis alone did not show difference before and after MBSR training. Conclusion: The brain works in rhythmic oscillation, and this rhythmic connection becomes more coherent with cardiac activity after 8 weeks of MBSR training. Individual APF is relatively stable and its interplay with cardiac activity may be a more sensitive index than power spectrum by monitoring the brainheart connection. This preliminary study has important implications for the neuroscientiﬁc measurement of meditative practice.},

For instance, somatosensory perception is impaired both during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle and when heartbeats evoke stronger cortical responses. Here, we test whether these cardiac effects originate from overall changes in cortical excitability. Cortical and corticospinal excitability were assessed using electroencephalographic and electromyographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation while concurrently monitoring cardiac activity with electrocardiography. Cortical and corticospinal excitability were found to be highest during systole and following stronger neural responses to heartbeats. Furthermore, in a motor task, hand–muscle activity and the associated desynchronization of sensorimotor oscillations were stronger during systole. These results suggest that systolic cardiac signals have a facilitatory effect on motor excitability—in contrast to sensory attenuation that was previously reported for somatosensory perception. Thus, it is possible that distinct time windows exist across the cardiac cycle, optimizing either perception or action.},

We combined machine learning techniques with electroencephalography with both simple, direct indices of task performance and computational model-derived indices of learning. Our results demonstrate that just as people are more sensitive to low magnitude, near-threshold sensory stimuli in certain cardiac phases, so are they more sensitive to low magnitude absolute prediction errors in the same cycles. However, this occurs even when the low magnitude prediction errors are associated with clearly suprathreshold sensory events. In addition, participants exhibiting stronger differences in their prediction error representations between cardiac cycles exhibited higher learning rates and greater task accuracy.},

Aside from the use of imaging data, cardiac awareness has frequently been studied by using the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a brain wave that appears contingent on the heartbeat. The present study aimed at localizing sources of the HEP. Multichannel EEG was recorded in 44 subjects while they performed a heartbeat perception task. This task was used to quantify interoceptive awareness and to subdivide the subjects into good and poor heartbeat perceivers. Analyses showed highest HEP amplitudes over frontal and frontocentral electrode locations in the time range of later than 200 ms after R-wave onset. By means of a BESA dipole-source-analysis, four sources of the HEP were identiﬁed which were located in the anterior cingulate, the right insula, the prefrontal cortex, and the left secondary somatosensory cortex. Good heartbeat perceivers showed both signiﬁcantly higher HEP amplitudes and higher dipole strength than poor heartbeat perceivers in all four cortical sources. We conclude that the identiﬁed structures are involved in the processing of cardiac signals, whereby anterior cingulate and right insula seem to serve as interoceptive centers for cardioception.

Clinical data suggest that cortisol may lower the threshold for interoceptive stimuli, while a pharmacological administration of cortisol decreases the sensitivity for physical symptoms. To clarify the role of cortisol for the processing of interoceptive signals, we investigated 16 healthy men on two occasions, once during the infusion of 4 mg of cortisol and once during the infusion of a placebo substance. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP; derived from resting EEG and ECG, during open and closed eyes), which are psychophysiological indicators for the cortical processing of cardioceptive signals, were measured over 6-min periods once before, and four times after the infusion (1—7, 11—17, 21—27 and 31—37 min). We found that HEP amplitudes were higher during open than during closed eyes between 1 and 17 min after cortisol infusion. There was no effect of cortisol on heart rate. We conclude that cortisol may rapidly modulate the cortical processing of cardioceptive neural signals. These results may have relevance for the effects of stress on the development and maintenance of psychosomatic symptoms. \# 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies showed that the visceral information is constantly processed by the brain, thereby potentially influencing cognition. One index of such process is the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an ERP component related to the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP is sensitive to a number of factors such as motivation, attention, pain, which are associated with higher levels of arousal. However, the role of arousal and its associated brain oscillations on the HEP has not been characterized, yet it could underlie the previous findings. Here we analysed the effects of high- (HA) and low-arousal (LA) induction on the HEP. Further, we investigated the brain oscillations and their role in the HEP in response to HA and LA inductions. As compared to LA, HA was associated with a higher HEP and lower alpha oscillations. Interestingly, individual differences in the HEP modulation by arousal induction were correlated with alpha oscillations. In particular, participants with higher alpha power during the arousal inductions showed a larger HEP in response to HA compared to LA. In summary, we demonstrated that arousal induction affects the cortical processing of heartbeats; and that the alpha oscillations may modulate this effect.},

Significance of group differences in HEP amplitude and their topographical distribution over the scalp were assessed by means of cluster-based permutation tests. Results: In particular during EC, and to a lesser extent during EO, people with ID had a larger amplitude late HEP component than controls at frontal electrodes 376–500 ms after the R-wave peak. Source localization suggested increased neural activity time-locked to heartbeats in people with ID mainly in anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortices. Conclusions: People with insomnia show insufficient adaptation of their brain responses to the ever-present heartbeats.

Research demonstrates that interoceptive markers can be modulated via exteroceptive stimuli and suggests that the emotional content of this information may produce distinct interoceptive outcomes. Here, we explored the impact of differently valenced exteroceptive information on the processing of interoceptive signals. Participants completed a repetition-suppression paradigm viewing repeating or alternating faces. In experiment 1, faces wore either angry or pained expressions to explore the interoceptive response to different types of negative stimuli in the observer. In experiment 2, expressions were happy or sad to compare interoceptive processing of positive and negative information. We measured the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) as a respective marker of intero- and exteroceptive processing. We observed increased HEP amplitude to repeated sad and pained faces coupled with reduced HEP and VEP amplitude to repeated angry faces. No effects were observed for positive faces. However, we found a signiﬁcant correlation between suppression of the HEP and VEP to repeating angry faces. Results highlight an effect of emotional expression on interoception and suggest an attentional trade-off between internal and external processing domains as a potential account of this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interoception, the sensing of visceral body signals, involves an interplay between neural and autonomic mechanisms. Clinical studies into this domain have focused on patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, showing that damage to relevant brain mechanisms can variously alter interoceptive functions. However, the association between peripheral cardiac‐system alterations and neurocognitive markers of interoception remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we examined multidimensional neural markers of interoception in patients with early stage of hypertensive disease (HTD) and healthy controls. Strategically, we recruited only HTD patients without cognitive impairment (as shown by neuropsychological tests), brain atrophy (as assessed with voxel‐based morphometry), or white matter abnormalities (as evidenced by diffusion tensor imaging analysis). Interoceptive domains were assessed through (a) a behavioral heartbeat detection task; (b) measures of the heart‐evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological cortical signature of attention to cardiac signals; and (c) neuroimaging recordings (MRI and fMRI) to evaluate anatomical and functional connectivity properties of key interoceptive regions (namely, the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex). Relative to controls, patients exhibited poorer interoceptive performance and reduced HEP modulations, alongside an abnormal association between interoceptive performance and both the volume and functional connectivity of the above regions. Such results suggest that peripheral cardiac‐system impairments can be associated with abnormal behavioral and neurocognitive signatures of interoception. More generally, our findings indicate that interoceptive processes entail bidirectional influences between the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems.},

In the present study, age-related morphological changes to the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological cortical representation of cardiac signals, and its association with self-reported everyday cognition were examined. A community sample of older adults showed an increased HEP amplitude, which could reflect a stronger representation of early stages of cardiac interoception, and a more anterior scalp distribution of the HEP, suggesting a more widespread configuration of the underlying neural generators, compared to a group of young adults. Furthermore, in older adults, HEP amplitude was negatively correlated with self-estimated everyday cognitive functioning. Older adults with pronounced cortical representations of peripheral signals may thus be more likely to take note of lapses in their own bodily and cognitive function, leading to lower estimates of their cognitive abilities. These results provide novel insights into age-related changes in interoceptive processing and their association with metacognitive judgments, with potentially far-reaching implications for cognitive aging and age-related cognitive decline.},

Moreover, the role of EEG reference in the estimation of functional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI), together with different multivariate modelling strategies, has not been investigated yet. Methods: This study identifies the best methodology combining a proper EEG electrical reference and signal processing methods for an effective functional BHI assessment. The effects of the EEG reference among common average, mastoids average, Laplacian reference, Cz reference, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) were explored throughout different BHI methods including synthetic data generation (SDG) model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient. Results: The SDG model exhibited high robustness between EEG references, whereas the maximal information coefficient method exhibited a high sensitivity. The common average and REST references for EEG showed a good consistency in the between-method comparisons. Laplacian, and Cz references significantly bias a BHI measurement. Comparison with existing methods: The use of EEG reference based on a common average outperforms on the use of other references for consistency in estimating directed functional BHI. We do not recommend the use of EEG references based on analytical derivations as the experimental conditions may not meet the requirements of their optimal estimation, particularly in clinical settings. Conclusion: The use of a common average for EEG electrical reference is concluded to be the most appropriate choice for a quantitative, functional BHI assessment.},

	abstract = {Frequent nightmares are highly prevalent and constitute a risk factor for a wide range of psychopathological conditions. Despite its prevalence and clinical relevance however, the pathophysiological mechanisms of nightmares are poorly understood. A recent study (Perogamvros et, al 2019) examined the heart beat evoked potential (HEP) in a small group of nightmare sufferers (N = 11) and matched healthy controls (N = 11) and observed markedly different (Hedges’ g = 1.42 [0.62–2.22]) HEP response across the groups during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, the HEP correlated with depression scores in the nightmare group only. The authors concluded that the HEP in REM sleep could be used as a trait-like biomarker reflecting pathological emotional-and sleep regulation in nightmare disorder. To replicate the above study, we performed the same analyses of HEPs in two separate, and larger databases comprising the polysomnographic recordings of nightmare sufferers and matched controls (NStudy 1 = 39 ; NStudy 2 = 41). In contrast to the original findings, we did not observe significant differences in HEP across the two groups in either of the two databases. Moreover, we found no associations between depression scores and HEP amplitudes in the relevant spatiotemporal cluster. Our data cast doubts on the utility of HEP as a biomarker in the diagnostic and treatment procedures of nightmare disorder and suggests that the interpretation of HEP as a marker of impaired arousal and emotional processing during REM sleep is premature and requires further validation.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientiﬁc studies have mainly focused on the way humans perceive and interact with the external world. Recent work in the interoceptive domain indicates that the brain predictively models information from inside the body such as the heartbeat and that the eﬃciency with which this is executed can have implications for exteroceptive processing. However, to date direct evidence underpinning these hypotheses is lacking. Here, we show how the brain predictively reﬁnes neural resources to process aﬀerent cardiac feedback and uses these interoceptive cues to enable more eﬃcient processing of external sensory information. Participants completed a repetition-suppression paradigm consisting of a neutral repeating face. During the ﬁrst face presentation, they heard auditory feedback of their heartbeat which either coincided with the systole of the cardiac cycle, the time at which cardiac events are registered by the brain or the diastole during which the brain receives no internal cardiac feedback. We used electroencephalography to measure the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) as well as auditory (AEP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Exteroceptive cardiac feedback which coincided with the systole produced signiﬁcantly higher HEP amplitudes relative to feedback timed to the diastole. Elevation of the HEP in this condition was followed by signiﬁcant suppression of the VEP in response to the repeated neutral face and a stepwise decrease of AEP amplitude to repeated heartbeat feedback. Our results hereby show that exteroceptive heartbeat feedback coinciding with interoceptive signals at systole enhanced interoceptive cardiac processing. Furthermore, the same cue facilitating interoceptive integration enabled eﬃcient suppression of a visual stimulus, as well as repetition suppression of the AEP across successive auditory heartbeat feedback. Our ﬁndings provide evidence that the alignment of external to internal signals can enhance the eﬃciency of interoceptive processing and that cues facilitating this process in either domain have beneﬁcial eﬀects for internal as well as external sensory processing.},

These effects were independent of the emotional attribute of the stop signal (i.e., emotional facial expression change or non-emotional color change).

The present study aimed at expanding the methodological toolbox for studying internal attention, by examining for the ﬁrst time whether the steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP), a well-established measure of attention, can diﬀerentiate between internally and externally directed attention. To this end, we designed a task in which ﬂickering dots were used to generate ssVEPs, and instructed participants to count visual targets (external attention condition) or their heartbeats (internal attention condition). We compared the ssVEP responses between conditions, along with alpha-band activity and the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) - two electrophysiological measures associated with internally directed attention. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that both the magnitude and the phase synchronization of the ssVEP decreased when attention was directed internally, suggesting that ssVEP measures are able to diﬀerentiate between internal and external attention. Additionally, and in line with previous ﬁndings, we found larger suppression of parieto-occipital alpha-band activity and an increase of the HEP amplitude in the internal attention condition. Furthermore, we found a trade-oﬀ between changes in ssVEP response and changes in HEP and alpha-band activity: when shifting from internal to external attention, increase in ssVEP response was related to a decrease in parieto-occipital alpha-band activity and HEP amplitudes. These ﬁndings suggest that shifting between external and internal directed attention prompts a re-allocation of limited processing resources that are shared between external sensory and interoceptive processing.},

	abstract = {Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. The brain’s dysfunctional processing of interoceptive information is increasingly recognized as an important component of anxiety disorders. However, the neural mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In the present study, patients with GAD and healthy control participants underwent an eyes-closed (EC) resting state (interoception) and eyesopen (EO) resting state (exteroception) without paying conscious attention to heartbeat. Electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded at the same time. The results show that in healthy controls, the heartbeat-evoked brain potential (HEP) was modulated by the conditions, with a significantly higher amplitude under EC than EO, while this was not the case in GAD patients. Further analysis revealed that the dysfunction of HEP modulation in GAD patients may be attributed to excessive interoceptive processing under EO, with a marginally higher HEP in GAD than in the healthy controls. Finally, the right prefrontal HEP amplitude during EC condition was significantly correlated with the severity of the patients’ anxiety symptoms. Our results suggest that altered cortical processing of interoceptive signals may play an important role in the pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder.},

	abstract = {Significance Our brain continuously receives signals from the body and the environment. Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they can affect our perception. Here, we show two distinct ways in which the heartbeat modulates conscious perception. First, increased heartbeat-evoked neural activity before stimulation is followed by decreased somatosensory detection. This effect can be explained by subjects adopting a more conservative decision criterion, which is accompanied by changes in early and late somatosensory-evoked responses. Second, stimulus timing during the cardiac cycle affects sensitivity but not criterion for somatosensory stimuli, which is reflected only in late somatosensory-evoked responses. We propose that these heartbeat-related modulations are connected to fluctuations of interoceptive attention and (unconscious) predictive coding mechanisms. , Even though humans are mostly not aware of their heartbeats, several heartbeat-related effects have been reported to influence conscious perception. It is not clear whether these effects are distinct or related phenomena, or whether they are early sensory effects or late decisional processes. Combining electroencephalography and electrocardiography, along with signal detection theory analyses, we identify two distinct heartbeat-related influences on conscious perception differentially related to early vs. late somatosensory processing. First, an effect on early sensory processing was found for the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a marker of cardiac interoception. The amplitude of the prestimulus HEP negatively correlated with localization and detection of somatosensory stimuli, reflecting a more conservative detection bias (criterion). Importantly, higher HEP amplitudes were followed by decreases in early (P50) as well as late (N140, P300) somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes. Second, stimulus timing along the cardiac cycle also affected perception. During systole, stimuli were detected and correctly localized less frequently, relating to a shift in perceptual sensitivity. This perceptual attenuation was accompanied by the suppression of only late SEP components (P300) and was stronger for individuals with a more stable heart rate. Both heart-related effects were independent of alpha oscillations’ influence on somatosensory processing. We explain cardiac cycle timing effects in a predictive coding account and suggest that HEP-related effects might reflect spontaneous shifts between interoception and exteroception or modulations of general attentional resources. Thus, our results provide a general conceptual framework to explain how internal signals can be integrated into our conscious perception of the world.},

	abstract = {Emotional trauma and psychological stress can precipitate cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death through arrhythmogenic effects of efferent sympathetic drive. Patients with preexisting heart disease are particularly at risk. Moreover, generation of proarrhythmic activity patterns within cerebral autonomic centers may be amplified by afferent feedback from a dysfunctional myocardium. An electrocortical potential reflecting afferent cardiac information has been described, reflecting individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity (awareness of one's own heartbeats). To inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis, we extended this approach, identifying electrocortical potentials corresponding to the cortical expression of afferent information about the integrity of myocardial function during stress. We measured changes in cardiac response simultaneously with electroencephalography in patients with established ventricular dysfunction. Experimentally induced mental stress enhanced cardiovascular indices of sympathetic activity (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, ventricular ejection fraction, and skin conductance) across all patients. However, the functional response of the myocardium varied; some patients increased, whereas others decreased, cardiac output during stress. Across patients, heartbeat-evoked potential amplitude at left temporal and lateral frontal electrode locations correlated with stress-induced changes in cardiac output, consistent with an afferent cortical representation of myocardial function during stress. Moreover, the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in the left temporal region reflected the proarrhythmic status of the heart (inhomogeneity of left ventricular repolarization). These observations delineate a cortical representation of cardiac function predictive of proarrhythmic abnormalities in cardiac repolarization. Our findings highlight the dynamic interaction of heart and brain in stress-induced cardiovascular morbidity.},

Two tasks were considered in our experiments to get more details about the differences between good and poor heartbeat perceivers at attention and resting state. Methods Thirty channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in 22 subjects, who had been subdivided into good and poor heartbeat perceivers by mental tracking task. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to remove cardiac field artifact (CFA) from the HEP. Results (1) The good heart-beat perceivers showed difference between attention and resting state in the windows from 250 ms to 450 ms after R wave at C3 location and from 100 ms to 300 ms after R wave at C4 location; (2) The difference waveforms between good and poor heartbeat perceivers was a positive waveform at FZ from 220 ms to 340 ms after R wave, which was more significant in attention state. Conclusion Attention state had more effect on the HEPs of good heartbeat perceivers than that of poor heartbeat perceivers; and perception ability influenced HEPs more strongly in the attention state than in the resting state.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of acute tonic pain on the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and to test whether or not pain perception can be reﬂected by the HEP. Methods: Simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded from 21 healthy young adults in three conditions: passive no-task control, no-pain control and cold pain. The HEP was obtained by using ECG R-peaks as event triggers. Results: Prominent HEP deﬂection was observed in both control conditions mainly over the frontal and central locations, while it was signiﬁcantly suppressed in the cold pain condition over the right-frontal, right-central and midline locations. A comparison of the data in the ﬁrst and last 5 min of cold pain condition showed that lower subjective pain ratings were accompanied by higher HEP magnitudes. A correlation analysis showed that the mean HEP magnitude over the midline locations was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with subjective pain ratings. Conclusions: Cold pain induces signiﬁcant suppression of the HEP across a number of scalp locations, and the suppression is correlated with self-report of pain. Signiﬁcance: The HEP has the potential to serve as an alternative pain measure. Ó 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze whether heartbeat perception accuracy is reduced in depressed patients. Furthermore, we investigated whether putative differences are reﬂected in heartbeat-evoked potentials. Method: We assessed the heartbeat perception score in 16 depressed patients and in matched healthy controls. A 63-channel EEG was recorded while participants counted pseudo-randomly presented target tones or heartbeats during a ﬁxed number of cardiac cycles. ECG R-waves served as the trigger for EEG averaging. The cardiac-ﬁeld artifact was minimized using independent component analysis and current–source density. Results: Behaviorally, the depressed sample showed less accurate heartbeat perception in comparison to the control group (p = .011). The two groups also demonstrated psychophysiological differences, showing that heartbeat-evoked potentials were signiﬁcantly reduced in depressed patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that heartbeat evoked potentials are objective markers of altered bodily awareness. Reduced interoception during depression may be linked to alexithymia, as well as to both decreased capacity for decision-making and for cognitive processing.},

Here, we show behavioral and neural dissociations between learning to follow one’s own heartbeat and metacognitive awareness of one’s performance, in a heartbeat-tapping task performed before and after auditory feedback. The electroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in interoceptive learners, that is, participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback, was higher compared with non-learners. However, an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30–45 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showing agreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitive awareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct cortical recordings in a single patient identiﬁed a network hub for interoceptive learning in the insular cortex. In summary, interoceptive learning may be mediated by the right insular response to the heartbeat, whereas metacognitive awareness of learning may be mediated by widespread cortical synchronization patterns.},

We tried to further determine interactions between cardiac and electrical brain activity by means of EEG. We investigated how the heartbeat modulates EEG in 23 healthy controls from wakefulness to deep sleep and showed that frontocentral heartbeat evoked EEG amplitude and phase locking (as measured by intertrial phase locking), at about 300-400 ms after the R peak, decreased with increasing sleep depth with a renewed increase during REM sleep, which underpins the assumption that the heartbeat evoked positivity constitutes an active frontocortical response to the heartbeat. Additionally, we found that individual heart rate was correlated with the frequency of the EEG’s spectral peak (i.e., alpha peak frequency during wakefulness). This correlation was strongest during wakefulness and declined linearly with increasing sleep depth. Furthermore, we show that the QRS complex modulates spindle phase possibly related to the correspondence between the frequency of the QRS complex and the spindle frequency of about 12–15 Hz. Finally, during deep sleep stages, a loose temporal coupling between heartbeats and slow oscillation (0.8 Hz) could be observed. These findings indicate that cardiac activity such as heart rate or individual heartbeats can modulate or be modulated by ongoing oscillatory brain activity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study performed at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs), an indicator of the cortical representation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, were investigated in 34 medication-free patients with BPD, 31 healthy volunteers, and 17 medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms, history of childhood traumatization, and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of disturbed body awareness, high-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest–based approaches. The study was performed between 2012 and 2014, and data analysis was performed in 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional dysregulation, as well as with gray matter volume. RESULTS Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes compared with healthy volunteers (F1,61 = 11.32, P = .001), whereas the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere in between these 2 groups of participants (P {\textbackslash}textgreater .05). The HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = −0.30, P = .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (R = 0.53, P {\textbackslash}textless .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (R = 0.47, P {\textbackslash}textless .05), 2 structures that have been identified as core regions for interoception. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results indicate state-dependent deficits in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD, which appear to be associated with core features of BPD. The analysis of patients with BPD in remission suggests an improvement in cortical representation of bodily signals with symptom remission. Results recommend the integration of techniques to strengthen bodily awareness in psychotherapeutic interventions of BPD.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interoception refers to the signaling of internal bodily commands. Here, we explore repetition suppression of intero- and exteroceptive neural markers to test whether the perception and predictability of exteroceptive stimulus material affects their expression. Participants completed a repetition suppression paradigm in which angry or neutral facial expressions repeated or alternated. Participants received either an implicit (experiment 1) or explicit (experiment 2) cue enabling the formation of expectations regarding the upcoming facial expression. We measured the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) indexing cardiac processing and visual evoked potentials (VEP) in response to viewing the second (repeated or alternated) face. Repeating angry facial expressions produced repetition suppression of both HEP and VEP amplitude while repeating neutral expressions led to repetition enhancement of HEP amplitude. This effect was magnified when participants were explicitly aware of predictive cues. Furthermore, repetition suppression of HEP amplitude correlated with neural attenuation of VEP activity. Results highlight repetition effects for interoceptive as well as exteroceptive neural markers and support top-down, expectation-based accounts of the phenomenon. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the perception of exteroceptive stimulus information has an effect on the processing of interoceptive signals and suggest a direct neural connection between the processing of external and internal sensory information.},

	abstract = {Attentional mechanisms have been studied mostly in specific sensory domains, such as auditory, visuospatial, or tactile modalities. In contrast, attention to internal interoceptive visceral targets has only recently begun to be studied, despite its potential importance in emotion, empathy, and self-awareness. Here, we studied the effects of shifting attention to the heart using a cue-target detection paradigm during continuous EEG recordings. Subjects were instructed to count either a series of visual stimuli (visual condition) or their own heartbeats (heart condition). Visual checkerboard stimuli were used as attentional probes throughout the task. Consistent with previous findings, attention modulated the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potentials. Directing attention to the heart significantly reduced the visual P1/N1 amplitude evoked by the attentional probe. ERPs locked to the attention-directing cue revealed a novel frontal positivity around 300 ms postcue. Finally, spectral power in the alpha band over parieto-occipital regions was higher while attending to the heart—when compared to the visual task—and correlated with subject’s performance in the interoceptive task. These results are consistent with a shared, resource-based attentional mechanism whereby allocating attention to bodily signals can affect early responses to visual stimuli.},

	abstract = {Background. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients typically overmonitor their own behavior, as shown by symptoms of excessive doubt and checking. Although this is well established for the patients’ relationship with external stimuli in the environment, no study has explored their monitoring of internal body signals, a process known to be affected in anxiety-related syndromes. Here, we explored this issue through a cardiac interoception task that measures sensing of heartbeats. Our aim was to explore key behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of internal-cue monitoring in OCD, while examining their potential distinctiveness in this condition. Method. We administered a heartbeat detection (HBD) task (with related interoceptive conﬁdence and awareness measures) to three matched groups (OCD patients, panic disorder patients, healthy controls) and recorded ongoing modulations of two task-relevant electrophysiological markers: the heart evoked potential (HEP) and the motor potential (MP). Results. Behaviorally, OCD patients outperformed controls and panic patients in the HBD task. Moreover, they exhibited greater amplitude modulation of both the HEP and the MP during cardiac interoception. However, they evinced poorer conﬁdence and awareness of their interoceptive skills. Conclusions. Convergent behavioral and electrophysiological data showed that overactive monitoring in OCD extends to the sensing of internal bodily signals. Moreover, this pattern discriminated OCD from panic patients, suggesting a condition-distinctive alteration. Our results highlight the potential of exploring interoceptive processes in the OCD spectrum to better characterize the population’s cognitive proﬁle. Finally, these ﬁndings may lay new bridges between somatic theories of emotion and cognitive models of OCD.},

Methods: We assessed the physiological dimensions of cardioception, i.e. the peripheral signal itself (heart rate, HR, and heart rate variability, HRV) and its cortical representation (heartbeat evoked potentials, HEPs), and the psychological dimensions of interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat perception) and interoceptive sensibility (conﬁdence ratings).

There was a trend toward better heartbeat perception in AN, but no group differences in HR, HRV, and conﬁdence ratings. Conclusions: Individuals with AN showed an interoceptive proﬁle of heightened cortical processing, a trend toward heightened interoceptive accuracy, and unaltered cardiac autonomic activation and interoceptive sensibility.},

	abstract = {Nightmares are characterized by the experience of strong negative emotions occurring mainly during REM sleep. Some people suffer from nightmare disorder, which is defined by the repeated occurrence of nightmares and by significant distress in wakefulness. Yet, whether frequent nightmares relate to a general increase in emotional reactivity or arousal during sleep remains unclear. To address this question, we recorded heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) during wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep in patients with nightmare disorder and healthy participants. The HEP represents a cortical (EEG) response to the heartbeat and indexes brain-body interactions, such as interoceptive processing and intrinsic levels of arousal. HEP amplitude is typically increased during states of high emotional arousal and motivation, and is decreased in depression. Here we compared the amplitude of HEPs between nightmare patients and healthy controls separately during AWAKE, NREM, REM periods, and found higher HEP amplitude in nightmare patients compared to healthy controls over a cluster of frontal regions only during REM sleep. This effect was not paralleled by any group difference in cardiac control measures (e.g. heart rate variability, interbeat interval). These findings corroborate the notion that nightmares are essentially a REM pathology and suggest that increased emotional arousal during REM sleep, as measured by HEP, is a physiological condition responsible for frequent nightmares. This result also supports that HEP may be used as a biomarker of increased emotional and sensory processing during REM sleep in these patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience difficulties in emotional awareness (alexithymia), and often develop dissociative symptoms, which may reflect broader deficits in interoceptive awareness. Whether this is associated with alterations in cortical processing of interoception is currently unknown. Methods: We utilized an electrophysiological marker of interoception, i.e. heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP), and examined its relationship with electrocardiographic correlates of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning (heart rate variability), and with self-report measures of alexithymia, dissociation and borderline symptom severity in patients with BPD. Results: Individuals with BPD had higher HEP amplitudes over frontal electrodes compared to healthy controls. Sympathetic ANS activity was greater in BPD patients than in controls. Across groups, HEP amplitudes were associated with parasympathetic activity over central electrodes and correlated with alexithymia over frontal electrodes. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that difficulties in emotional awareness in BPD are reflected in altered frontal electrophysiological markers of interception. Therefore, emotional awareness can be understood as failures of modulation between interoceptive and exteroceptive attention. Future research may aim to investigate whether altered interoception and its electrophysiological correlates are malleable by therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Emotional dysregulation, a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has recently been linked to deficits in the cortical representation of bodily signals. Oxytocin modulates the salience of external social cues. However, its role in interoception is still not fully understood. The aim of the current study was to replicate reduced heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) as a marker for the cortical representation of cardiac signals in BPD and to explore potential effects of oxytocin on HEP amplitude. Methods: Fifty-three medication-free women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and sixty healthy female controls (HCs) participated in the study. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, participants self-administered either 24 I.U. of oxytocin or placebo and took part in a 5-minute resting-state electrocardiogram (ECG) with parallel electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement. In addition, emotional dysregulation and BPD symptomatology were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Results: Patients with BPD had significantly lower mean HEP amplitudes than HCs. Furthermore, HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation in the whole sample. However, oxytocin had no significant effect on HEP amplitude. Limitations: Only female participants were investigated and no clinicial controls were included. Conclusions: This is the first replication from an independent sample showing a reduced cortical representation of cardiac signals in BPD patients. This, together with other body-related symptoms, suggests deficits in the processing of bodily signals, which seem to be associated with emotional dysregulation. Whether oxytocin influences HEP during emotion regulation tasks needs to be investigated in future studies.},

	abstract = {Our perception of the external world is inﬂuenced by internal bodily signals. For example, we recently showed that timing of stimulation along the cardiac cycle and spontaneous ﬂuctuations of heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes inﬂuence somatosensory perception and the associated neural processing (Al et al., 2020). While cardiac phase aﬀected detection sensitivity and late components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), HEP amplitudes aﬀected detection criterion and both early and late SEP components. In a new EEG study, we investigate whether these results are replicable in a modiﬁed paradigm, which includes two succeeding temporal intervals. In one of the intervals, subjects received a weak electrical ﬁnger stimulation and reported ﬁrst whether they detected any stimulation and then allocated the stimulus to one of the two intervals. Our results conﬁrm the previously reported cardiac cycle and prestimulus HEP eﬀects on somatosensory perception and evoked potentials. In addition, we obtained two new ﬁndings. Source analyses in this and our original study show that the increased likelihood of conscious perception goes along with HEP ﬂuctuations in parietal and posterior cingulate regions, known to play important roles in interoceptive processes. Furthermore, HEP amplitudes were shown to decrease when subjects engaged in the somatosensory task compared to a resting state condition. Our ﬁndings are consistent with the view that HEP amplitudes are a marker of interoceptive (versus exteroceptive) attention and provide a neural underpinning for this view.},

We performed a retrospective analysis of polysomnographic recordings of 39 healthy volunteers. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), measuring IS and IA, and underwent hypnotic assessment via the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form A. The amplitude of the early and late HEP components was computed at EEG frontal and central sites. In both regions, the early HEP component was larger in N3 than in N2 and REM, with no difference between N2 and REM. Greater HEP amplitude at frontal than at central sites was found for the late HEP component. HEP amplitudes were not inﬂuenced by the autonomic state assessed by heart rate variability in the frequency and time domains. We report for the ﬁrst time a positive correlation between the central late HEP component and MAIA dimensions, which became non-signiﬁcant after removing the effects of hypnotizability.

	abstract = {Abstract An accruing body of research has shown that interoception (the sensing of signals from the body's internal milieu) relies on both a direct route (afforded by the vagus nerve) and a secondary route (supported by somatosensory mechanisms). However, no study has causally tested the differential role of these pathways, let alone via direct stimulation. To bridge this gap, we tested whether multidimensional signatures of interoception are modulated by noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS). Sixty‐three participants were divided into an nVNS and a sham‐stimulation group. Before and after stimulation, both groups performed a validated heartbeat detection (HBD) task including a genuinely interoceptive condition (monitoring one's own heartbeat) and a control exteroceptive condition (tracking an aurally presented heartbeat). Electroencephalographic signals were obtained during both conditions to examine modulations of the heartbeat‐evoked potential (HEP). Moreover, before and after stimulation, participants were asked to complete a somatosensory heartbeat localization task. Results from the interoceptive condition revealed that, after treatment, only the nVNS group exhibited improved performance and greater HEP modulations. No behavioral differences were found for the exteroceptive control condition, which was nonetheless associated with significant HEP modulations. Finally, no between‐group differences were observed regarding the localization of the heartbeat sensations or relevant cardiodynamic variables (heart rate and or heart rate variability). Taken together, these results constitute unprecedented evidence that the vagus nerve plays a direct role in neurovisceral integration during interoception. This finding can constrain mechanistic models of the domain while informing a promising transdiagnostic agenda for interoceptive impairments across neuropsychiatric conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: Early life maltreatment is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe and heterogeneous disorder with fluctuating states of emotional over- and undermodulation, including hypervigilance, dissociation, and emotion regulation deficits. The perception and regulation of emotions have been linked to interoception, the cortical representation and sensing of inner bodily processes. Although first therapeutic approaches targeting bodily sensations have been found effective in patients with PTSD, and deficits in interoceptive signal representation have been reported in other trauma-related disorders, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), the role of interoception remains largely unexplored for PTSD. Objective: The objective was to investigate the cortical representation of cardiac interoceptive signals in patients with PTSD and its associations with early life maltreatment, trait dissociation, and emotion dysregulation. Methods: Twenty-four medication-free patients with PTSD and 31 healthy controls (HC) completed a 5-min resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with parallel electroencephalogram (EEG). Heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes as a measure for cortical representation of cardiac interoceptive signals were compared between groups and correlated with selfreport questionnaires. Results: We did not find significantly different mean HEP amplitudes in patients with PTSD compared to HC, although HEPs of patients with PTSD were descriptively higher. No significant associations between mean HEP amplitudes and early life maltreatment, trait dissociation or emotion dysregulation were obtained within the groups. Conclusion: The current finding does not indicate deficits in interoceptive signal representation at rest in individuals with PTSD. Whether patients with PTSD show altered HEP modulations during emotion regulation tasks and might benefit from therapeutic approaches aiming at changing the perception of bodily signals, needs to be investigated in future studies.},

The current study investigated relation between trait mindfulness (i.e., individual differences in the ability to be mindful in daily life) and body awareness in combining a self-report measure (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness [MAIA] questionnaire) with analysis of the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), which is an event-related potential reflecting the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP data were collected from 17 healthy participants under five minutes of resting-state condition. In addition, each participant completed the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory and the MAIA questionnaire. Taking account of the important variability of HEP effects, analyses were replicated with the same participants three times (in three distinct sessions). First, group-level analyses showed that HEP amplitude and trait mindfulness do not correlate. Secondly, we observed that HEP amplitude could positively correlate with self-reported body awareness; however, this association was unreliable over time. Interestingly, we found that HEP measure shows very poor reliability over time at the individual level, potentially explaining the lack of reliable association between HEP and psychological traits. Lastly, a reliable positive correlation was found between self-reported trait mindfulness and body awareness. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence that the HEP might not support the increased subjective body awareness in trait mindfulness, thus suggesting that perhaps objective and subjective measures of body awareness could be independent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is a brain response to each heartbeat, which is thought to reﬂect cardiac signaling to central autonomic areas and suggested to be a marker of internal body awareness (eg, interoception). OBJECTIVES Because cardiac communication with central autonomic circuits has been shown to be impaired in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation (AF), we hypothesized that HEPs are attenuated in these patients. METHODS By simultaneous electroencephalography and electrocardiography recordings, HEP was investigated in 56 individuals with persistent AF and 56 control subjects matched for age, sex, and body mass index. RESULTS HEP in control subjects was characterized by right frontotemporal negativity peaking around 300 to 550 ms after the R-peak, consistent with previous studies. In comparison with control subjects, HEP amplitudes were attenuated, and HEP amplitude differences remained signiﬁcant when matching the samples for heart frequency, stroke volume (assessed by echocardiography), systolic blood pressure, and the amplitude of the T-wave. Effect sizes for the group differences were medium to large (Cohen’s d between 0.6 and 0.9). EEG source analysis on HEP amplitude differences pointed to a neural representation within the right insular cortex, an area known as a hub for central autonomic control. CONCLUSIONS The heartbeat-evoked potential is reduced in AF, particularly in the right insula. We speculate that the attenuated HEP in AF may be a marker of impaired heart–brain interactions. Attenuated interoception might furthermore underlie the frequent occurrence of silent AF. (J Am Coll Cardiol EP 2022;8:1219–1230) © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The heart and brain are reciprocally interconnected and engage in two-way communication for homeostatic regulation. Epilepsy is considered a network disease that also affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The neurovisceral integration model (NVM) proposes that cardiac vagal tone, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), can indicate the functional integrity of cognitive neural networks. ANS activity and the pattern of oscillatory EEG activity covary during the transition of arousal states and associations between cortical and autonomic activity are reflected by HRV. Cognitive dysfunction is one of the common comorbidities that occur in epilepsy, including memory, attention, and processing difficulties. Recent studies have shown evidence for the active involvement of alpha activity in cognitive processes through its active role in the control of neural excitability in the cortex through top-down modulation of cortical networks. In the present pilot study, we evaluated the association between resting EEG oscillatory behavior and ANS function in patients with refractory epilepsy. Our results show: (1) In patients with refractory epilepsy, there is a strong positive correlation between HRV and the power of cortical oscillatory cortical activity in all studied EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) in all regions of interest in both hemispheres, the opposite pattern found in controls which had low or negative correlation between these variables; (2) higher heartbeat evoked potential amplitudes in patients with refractory epilepsy than in controls. Taken together, these results point to a significant alteration in heart-brain interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Because consciousness does not necessarily translate into overt behaviour, detecting residual consciousness in noncommunicating patients remains a challenge. Bedside diagnostic methods based on EEG are promising and costeffective alternatives to detect residual consciousness. Recent evidence showed that the cortical activations triggered by each heartbeat, namely, heartbeatevoked responses (HERs), can detect through machine learning the presence of minimal consciousness and distinguish between overt and covert minimal consciousness. In this study, we explore different markers to characterize HERs to investigate whether different dimensions of the neural responses to heartbeats provide complementary information that is not typically found under standard event-related potential analyses. We evaluated HERs and EEG average non-locked to heartbeats in six types of participants: healthy state, locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, comatose and brain-dead patients. We computed a series of markers from HERs that can generally separate the unconscious from the conscious. Our findings indicate that HER variance and HER frontal segregation tend to be higher in the presence of consciousness. These indices, when combined with heart rate variability, have the potential to enhance the differentiation between different levels of awareness. We propose that a multidimensional evaluation of brain–heart interactions could be included in a battery of tests to characterize disorders of consciousness. Our results may motivate further exploration of markers in brain–heart communication for the detection of consciousness at the bedside. The development of diagnostic methods based on brain–heart interactions may be translated into more feasible methods for clinical practice.},

There is weak evidence of physiological changes in cortical activity under VF. Moreover, brain–heart communication has not previously been studied in this condition. We aimed to measure parallel changes in heart-rate variability (HRV), cortical activity, and brain–heart interactions in a patient who experienced VF. Methods The EEG and EKG signals for the case report were acquired for approximately 20 h. We selected different 1-min-long segments based on the changes in the EKG waveform. We present the changes in heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs), HRV, and EEG power for each selected segment. Results The overall physiological activity appeared to deteriorate as VF proceeded. Brain–heart interactions measured using HERs disappeared, with a few aberrant amplitudes appearing occasionally. The parallel changes in EEG and HRV were not pronounced, suggesting the absence of bidirectional neural control. Conclusions Our measurements of brain–heart interactions suggested that the evolving VF impairs communication between the central and autonomic nervous systems. These results may support that reduced brain–heart interactions reflect loss of consciousness and deterioration in the overall health state.},

	abstract = {Feeling happy, or judging whether someone else is feeling happy are two distinct facets of emotions that nevertheless rely on similar physiological and neural activity. Diﬀerentiating between these two states, also called Self/Other distinction, is an essential aspect of empathy, but how exactly is it implemented? In non-emotional cognition, the transient neural response evoked at each heartbeat, or heartbeat evoked response (HER), indexes the self and signals Self/Other distinction. Here, using electroencephalography (n = 32), we probe whether HERs’ role in Self/Other distinction extends also to emotion – a domain where brain-body interactions are particularly relevant. We asked participants to rate independently validated aﬀective scenes, reporting either their own emotion (Self) or the emotion expressed by people in the scene (Other). During the visual cue indicating to adopt the Self or Other perspective, before the aﬀective scene, HERs distinguished between the two conditions, in visual cortices as well as in the right frontal operculum. Physiological reactivity (facial electromyogram, skin conductance, heart rate) during aﬀective scene co-varied as expected with valence and arousal ratings, but also with the Self- or Other- perspective adopted. Finally, HERs contributed to the subjective experience of valence in the Self condition, in addition to and independently from physiological reactivity. We thus show that HERs represent a trans-domain marker of Self/Other distinction, here speciﬁcally contributing to experienced valence. We propose that HERs represent a form of evidence related to the ‘I’ part of the judgement ‘To which extent do I feel happy’. The ‘I’ related evidence would be combined with the aﬀective evidence collected during aﬀective scene presentation, accounting at least partly for the diﬀerence between feeling an emotion and identifying it in someone else.},

	abstract = {Interoception has been proposed as a factor that influences various psychological processes (Khalsa et al., 2018). Afferent signals from the cardiovascular system vary across cardiac cycle phases. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP) and event-related potentials (ERP) were measured to examine whether interoceptive signals differed between cardiac cycle phases. Simultaneously, participants performed an auditory oddball task in which the timing of the presenting stimulus was synchronized with the heartbeat. Pure tones were presented at 10 ms (late diastole condition), 200 ms (systole condition), or 500 ms after the R wave (diastole condition). Greater HEP amplitudes were observed when the tone was presented during diastole than during systole or late diastole. ERP showed the same tendency: a greater amplitude was observed during diastole than systole or late diastole. These results suggest that the processing of interoception reflected by HEP and exteroception reflected by ERP share attentional resources when both stimuli coincide. When the tone was presented during systole, attention to the internal state decreased compared with when the tone was presented during diastole, and attention was distributed to both exteroception and interoception. Our study suggests that HEP may be considered an indication of a relative amount of resources to process the interoception.},

	abstract = {Background: Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) is usually obtained to assess seizures in comatose patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aim to investigate rsEEG measures and their prediction of early recovery of consciousness in patients with TBI. Methods: This is a retrospective study of comatose patients with TBI who were admitted to a trauma center (October 2013 to January 2022). Demographics, basic clinical data, imaging characteristics, and EEGs were collected. We calculated the following using 10-min rsEEGs: power spectral density, permutation entropy (complexity measure), weighted symbolic mutual information (wSMI, global information sharing measure), Kolmogorov complexity (Kolcom, complexity measure), and heart-evoked potentials (the averaged EEG signal relative to the corresponding QRS complex on electrocardiography). We evaluated the prediction of consciousness recovery before hospital discharge using clinical, imaging, and rsEEG data via a support vector machine. Results: We studied 113 of 134 (84\%) patients with rsEEGs. A total of 73 (65\%) patients recovered consciousness before discharge. Patients who recovered consciousness were younger (40 vs. 50 years, p = 0.01). Patients who recovered also had higher Kolcom (U = 1688, p = 0.01), increased beta power (U = 1,652 p = 0.003) with higher variability across channels (U = 1534, p = 0.034) and epochs (U = 1711, p = 0.004), lower delta power (U = 981, p = 0.04), and higher connectivity across time and channels as measured by wSMI in the theta band (U = 1636, p = 0.026; U = 1639, p = 0.024) than those who did not recover. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for rsEEG was higher than that for clinical data (using age, motor response, pupil reactivity) and higher than that for the Marshall computed tomography classification (0.69 vs. 0.66 vs. 0.56, respectively; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Conclusions: We describe the rsEEG signature in recovery of consciousness prior to discharge in comatose patients with TBI. rsEEG measures performed modestly better than the clinical and imaging data in predicting recovery.},

The present high‐density electroencephalography (hdEEG) study aims to assess cardiac interoception in AN and to investigate its neural correlates, using an objective neurophysiological measure. Method: Heartbeat‐evoked potentials (HEPs) were computed from 5 min of resting‐state EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) data and compared between individuals with AN (N = 22) and healthy controls (HC) (N = 19) with waveform, topographic, and source imaging analyses. Results: Differences in the cortical representation of heartbeats were present between AN and HC at a time window of 332–348 ms after the ECG R‐peak. Source imaging analyses revealed a right‐sided hypoactivation in AN of brain regions linked to interoceptive processing, such as the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal areas. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using hdEEG to localise the underlying sources of HEPs in AN. Results point to altered interoceptive processing during resting‐state in AN. As our participants had a short duration of illness, this might not be the consequence of prolonged starvation. Interventions targeted at interoception could provide an additional tool to facilitate recovery.},

However, the interplay between affective arousal and changes in interoceptive processing at the onset of dissociative seizures is not well understood. Methods Using retrospective routine data obtained from video-electroencephalography telemetry in a university hospital epilepsy monitoring unit, we investigate ictal changes in cardiac indices of autonomic arousal and heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs) in 24 patients with dissociative seizures. Results Results show autonomic arousal during seizures with increased heart rate and a shift towards sympathetic activity. Compared with baseline, ictal HEP amplitudes over central and right prefrontal electrodes (F8, Fz) were significantly less pronounced during seizures, suggesting diminished cortical representation of interoceptive information. Significant correlations between heart rate variability measures and HEPs were observed at baseline, with more sympathetic and less parasympathetic activity related to less pronounced HEPs. Interestingly, these relationships weakened during seizures, suggesting a disintegration of autonomic arousal and interoceptive processing during dissociative seizures. In a subgroup of 16 patients, MRI-based cortical thickness analysis found a correlation with HEP amplitudes in the left somatosensory association cortex. Conclusions These findings possibly represent an electrophysiological hint of how autonomic arousal could negatively impact bodily awareness in dissociative seizures, and how these processes might be related to underlying brain structure.},

Methods Here, we examined the effects of voluntary hyperventilation (VH) as part of a clinical routine examination on scalp-recorded HEPs in epilepsy patients ( N = 80). Results Using cluster-based permutation analyses, HEP amplitudes were compared across pre-VH and post-VH conditions within young and elderly subgroups, as well as for the total sample. No differences in the HEP were detected for younger participants or across the full sample, while an increased late HEP during pre-VH compared to post-VH was fond in the senior group, denoting decreased cardiac interoceptive processing after hyperventilation. Discussion The present study, thus, provides initial evidence of breathing-related HEP modulations in elderly epilepsy patients, emphasizing the potential of HEP as an interoceptive neural marker that could partially extend to the representation of pulmonary signaling. We speculate that aberrant CO 2 -chemosensing, coupled with disturbances in autonomic regulation, might constitute the underlying pathophysiological mechanism behind the obtained effect. Available databases involving patient records of routine VH assessment may constitute a valuable asset in disentangling the interplay of cardiac and ventilatory interoceptive information in various patient groups, providing thorough clinical data to parse, as well as increased statistical power and estimates of effects with higher precision through large-scale studies.},

The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is an EEG ﬂuctuation reﬂecting the cortical processing of cardiac signals.

This may have been due to reduced cardiac perception during inhalation and heightened perception during exhalation through attentional mechanisms. To investigate relationships between HEP, attention, and respiration, we introduced an experimental setup that included tasks related to cardiac and respiratory interoceptive and exteroceptive attention. Results revealed HEP amplitude increases during the interoceptive tasks over fronto-central electrodes. When respiratory phases were taken into account, HEP increases were primarily driven by heartbeats recorded during exhalation, speciﬁcally during the cardiac interoceptive task, while inhalation had minimal impact.

How does the brain tag the protagonist of an imagined scene as being oneself or someone else? Crucially, during imagination, neither external stimuli nor motor feedback are available to disentangle imagining oneself from imagining someone else. Here, we test the hypothesis that an internal mechanism based on the neural monitoring of heartbeats could distinguish between self and other. 23 participants imagined themselves (from a ﬁrst-person perspective) or a friend (from a third-person perspective) in various scenarios, while their brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography and their cardiac activity was simultaneously monitored. We measured heartbeat-evoked responses, i.e. transients of neural activity occurring in response to each heartbeat, during imagination. The amplitude of heartbeat-evoked responses differed between imagining oneself and imagining a friend, in the precuneus and posterior cingulate regions bilaterally. Effect size was modulated by the daydreaming frequency scores of participants but not by their interoceptive abilities. These results could not be accounted for by other characteristics of imagination (e.g., the ability to adopt the perspective, valence or arousal), nor by cardiac parameters (e.g., heart rate) or arousal levels (e.g. arousal ratings, pupil diameter). Heartbeat-evoked responses thus appear as a neural marker distinguishing self from other during imagination.},

	abstract = {Several theories propose that emotions and self-awareness arise from the integration of internal and external signals and their respective precision-weighted expectations. Supporting these mechanisms, research indicates that the brain uses temporal cues from cardiac signals to predict auditory stimuli and that these predictions and their prediction errors can be observed in the scalp heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP). We investigated the effect of precision modulations on these cross-modal predictive mechanisms, via attention and interoceptive ability. We presented auditory sequences at short (perceived synchronous) or long (perceived asynchronous) cardio-audio delays, with half of the trials including an omission. Participants attended to the cardio-audio synchronicity of the tones (internal attention) or the auditory stimuli alone (external attention). Comparing HEPs during omissions allowed for the observation of pure predictive signals, without contaminating auditory input. We observed an early effect of cardio-audio delay, ref lecting a difference in heartbeat-driven expectations. We also observed a larger positivity to the omissions of sounds perceived as synchronous than to the omissions of sounds perceived as asynchronous when attending internally only, consistent with the role of attentional precision for enhancing predictions. These results provide support for attentionally modulated cross-modal predictive coding and suggest a potential tool for investigating its role in emotion and self-awareness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The predictive coding theory of allostatic-interoceptive load states that brain networks mediating autonomic regulation and interoceptive-exteroceptive balance regulate the internal milieu to anticipate future needs and environmental demands. These functions seem to be distinctly compromised in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), including alterations of the allostatic-interoceptive network (AIN). Here, we hypothesize that bvFTD is typiﬁed by an allostatic-interoceptive overload. METHODS: We assessed resting-state heartbeat evoked potential (rsHEP) modulation as well as its behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging correlates in patients with bvFTD relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (N = 94). We measured 1) resting-state electroencephalography (to assess the rsHEP, prompted by visceral inputs and modulated by internal body sensing), 2) associations between rsHEP and its neural generators (source location), 3) cognitive disturbances (cognitive state, executive functions, facial emotion recognition), 4) brain atrophy, and 5) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (AIN vs. control networks). RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease, patients with bvFTD presented more negative rsHEP amplitudes with sources in critical hubs of the AIN (insula, amygdala, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex). This exacerbated rsHEP modulation selectively predicted the patients’ cognitive proﬁle (including cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and emotional impairments). In addition, increased rsHEP modulation in bvFTD was associated with decreased brain volume and connectivity of the AIN. Machine learning results conﬁrmed AIN speciﬁcity in predicting the bvFTD group. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results suggest that bvFTD may be characterized by an allostatic-interoceptive overload manifested in ongoing electrophysiological markers, brain atrophy, functional networks, and cognition.},

We observed that HER co-fluctuates with stroke volume on a beat-to-beat basis, but only when no correction for cardiac artifact was performed. This highlights the importance of an ICA correction tailored to the cardiac artifact. We also observed that easy-to-measure cardiac parameters (interbeat intervals, ECG amplitude) are sensitive to stroke volume fluctuations and can be used as proxies when stroke volume measurements are not available. Finally, interindividual differences in stroke volume were reflected in MEG data, but whether this effect is locked to heartbeats is unclear. Altogether, our results question assumptions on the link between stroke volume and HERs.},

	abstract = {The perception of internal bodily signals (interoception) is central to many theories of emotion and embodied cognition. According to recent theoretical views, the sensory processing of visceral signals such as one's own heartbeat is determined by top-down predictions about the expected interoceptive state of the body (interoceptive inference). In this EEG study we examined neural responses to heartbeats following expected and unexpected emotional stimuli. We used a modified stimulus repetition task in which pairs of facial expressions were presented with repeating or alternating emotional content, and we manipulated the emotional valence and the likelihood of stimulus repetition. We found that affective predictions of external socially relevant information modulated the heartbeat-evoked potential, a marker of cardiac interoception. Crucially, the HEP changes highly relied on the expected emotional content of the facial expression. Thus, expected negative faces led to a decreased HEP amplitude, whereas such an effect was not observed after an expected neutral face. These results suggest that valence-specific affective predictions, and their uniquely associated predicted bodily sensory state, can reduce or amplify cardiac interoceptive responses. In addition, the affective repetition effects were dependent on repetition probability, highlighting the influence of top-down exteroceptive predictions on interoception. Our results are in line with recent models of interoception supporting the idea that predicted bodily states influence sensory processing of salient external information.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate autonomic nervous system activity measured by brain–heart interactions in comatose patients after cardiac arrest in relation to the severity and prognosis of hypoxic–ischemic brain injury. Methods: Strength and complexity of bidirectional interactions between EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, and alpha) and ECG heart rate variability frequency bands (low frequency, LF and high frequency, HF) were computed using a synthetic data generation model. Primary outcome was the severity of brain injury, assessed by (i) standardized qualitative EEG classiﬁcation, (ii) somatosensory evoked potentials (N20), and (iii) neuron-speciﬁc enolase levels. Secondary outcome was the 3-month neurological status, assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category score [good (1–2) vs. poor outcome (3–4–5)]. Results: Between January 2007 and July 2021, 181 patients were admitted to ICU for a resuscitated cardiac arrest. Poor neurological outcome was observed in 134 patients (74\%). Qualitative EEG patterns suggesting high severity were associated with decreased LF/HF. Severity of EEG changes were proportional to higher absolute values of brain-to-heart coupling strength (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.02 for all brain-to-heart frequencies) and lower values of alpha-to-HF complexity (p = 0.049). Brain-toheart coupling strength was signiﬁcantly higher in patients with bilateral absent N20 and correlated with neuron-speciﬁc enolase levels at Day 3. This aberrant brain-to-heart coupling (increased strength and decreased complexity) was also associated with 3-month poor neurological outcome. Interpretation: Our results suggest that autonomic dysfunctions may well represent hypoxic–ischemic brain injury post cardiac arrest pathophysiology. These results open avenues for integrative monitoring of autonomic functioning in critical care patients.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the body’s psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical reports (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a forthcoming publication (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception. Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of “normal” psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials (ERP) and heartbeatevoked potentials (HBEP) were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/ accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed. Results: The main findings presented here are: (1) surprisingly, both the heart and brain appear to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) even more surprisingly, there is compelling evidence that the heart appears to receive intuitive information before the brain; (3) there were significant differences in prestimulus ERPs for calm versus emotional stimuli; (4) the frontal cortex, temporal, occipital, and parietal areas appear to be involved in the processing of prestimulus information; (5) there were significant differences in prestimulus calm/emotional HBEPs, primarily in the coherent mode; (6) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Especially noteworthy is the apparent interaction between the HBEPs and ERPs in the females, which suggests that the heart modulates the ERP and that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that the heart and brain, together, are involved in receiving, processing, and decoding intuitive information. On the basis of these results and those of other research, it would thus appear that intuitive perception is a system-wide process in which both the heart and brain (and possibly other bodily systems) play a critical role. To account for the study’s results, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about “future” events is spectrally enfolded.},

We found that the group with a prior infection showed decreased HEP (but not P300) amplitudes, as well as reduced attention/concentration performance.

	abstract = {Self-disturbance is considered a core feature underlying the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Interoception has an important role in the development of a sense of self, leading to increased interest in the potential contribution of abnormal interoception to self-disturbances in schizophrenia. Several neuropsychological studies have demonstrated aberrant interoception in schizophrenia. However, cortical interoceptive processing has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Thus, we sought to examine resting-state heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) in this population. We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would exhibit significant alterations in HEP compared to healthy controls (HCs). In this cross-sectional electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we compared the HEPs between age- and sex-matched groups of patients with schizophrenia and HCs. A 10-min resting-state EEG with eyes closed and an electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded and analyzed for the time window of 450 ms to 500 ms after an ECG R peak. A positive HEP shift was observed in the frontal-central regions (F [1, 82] = 7.402, p = 0.008, partial η2 = 0.009) in patients with schizophrenia (n = 61) when compared with HCs (n = 31) after adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and heart rate. A cluster-based correction analysis revealed that the HEP around the right frontal area (Fp2, F4, and F8) showed the most significant group differences (F [1, 82] = 10.079, p = 0.002, partial η2 = 0.021), with a peak at the F4 electrode site (F [1, 82] = 12.646, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001, partial η2 = 0.069). We observed no correlation between HEP and symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. A positive shift of HEP during the late component could reflect a trait abnormality in schizophrenia. Further research is required to determine the association between the altered cortical interoceptive processing indexed with HEP and self-disturbances in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) influences cardiac functions, hemodynamic characteristics and cerebral blood flow. However, little is known about whether or how the EECP affects the brain-heart coupling to produce these physiological and functional changes. We aimed to determine if the brain-heart coupling is altered during or after EECP intervention by assessing the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) in healthy adults. Methods: Based on a random sham-controlled design, simultaneous electroencephalography and electrocardiography signals as well as blood pressure and flow status data were recorded before, during and after two consecutive 30-min EECP in 40 healthy adults (female/male: 17/23; age: 23.1 ± 2.3 years). HEP amplitude, frequency domain heart rate variability, electroencephalographic power and hemodynamic measurements of 21 subjects (female/male: 10/11; age: 22.7 ± 2.1 years) receiving active EECP were calculated and compared with those of 19 sham control subjects (female/male: 7/12; age: 23.6 ± 2.5 years). Results: EECP intervention caused immediate obvious fluctuations of HEP from 100 to 400 ms after T-peak and increased HEP amplitudes in the (155–169) ms, (354–389) ms and (367–387) ms time windows after T-peak in the region of the frontal pole lobe. The modifications in HEP amplitude were not associated with changes in the analyzed significant physiological measurements and hemodynamic variables. Discussion: Our study provides evidence that the HEP is modulated by immediate EECP stimuli. We speculate that the increased HEP induced by EECP may be a marker of enhanced brain-heart coupling. HEP may serve as a candidate biomarker for the effects and responsiveness to EECP.},

EEG and ECG were recorded in 46 adolescents during a resting condition and during a heartbeat detection task. Participants were asked for conﬁdence in their interoceptive accuracy during heartbeat perception. HEPs appeared during both conditions, showing maximal activity over frontocentral electrodes in the heartbeat condition, and highest activity over occipital locations in the resting condition. Interoceptive accuracy (IAc) was positively associated with the HEP at frontocentral locations only for the heartbeat condition. Interoceptive sensibility was not associated with the HEP. No signiﬁcant association between IAc and interoceptive sensibility was revealed. Our results highlight the relevance of the HEP as a neural marker of interoception in adolescents.

The current study explores psychophysiological modulation in diabetic distress in response to Surah Al-Rehman recitation. A single-group experimental study with before and after intervention assessments was conducted during April 2018 to February 2019 in which participants (n = 10) listened to Surah Al-Rehman recitation. Blood pressure, blood glucose, cortisol, ECG and EEG were recorded before and after recitation. Significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, increase in low frequency and absolute alpha power at Fp2 were observed. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEP) were also significantly modulated at Fp1, Fp2 and F4. These findings suggest that Surah Al-Rehman modulated baroreflex activity thereby reducing sympathetic activity and improved heart brain coherence as reflected by HEP.},

	abstract = {Interoceptive signalling has been shown to contribute to action regulation and action experience. Here, we assess whether motor behaviour can be inﬂuenced by anticipated homeostatic feeling states induced through different predictable contexts. Participants performed a reward incentive paradigm in which accurate responses increased (gain) or avoided the depletion (averted loss) of a credit score. Across two types of blocks, we varied the predictability of the outcome state. In predictable blocks, a cue signaled a gain, loss or control trial (motor response did not affect the credit score). This allowed participants to anticipate the interoceptive feeling state associated with the outcome. In unpredictable blocks, the cue had no relation to the type of outcome. Thus, participants were unable to anticipate the feeling state it produced. Via EEG, we measured the Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) and the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) as indices of interoceptive and motor processing respectively. In addition, we measured feedback P3 amplitude following outcome presentation and accuracy and reaction times of the required motor response. We observed higher HEP and CNV amplitudes as well as faster and more accurate motor responses in predictable compared to unpredictable outcome blocks. Similarly, feedback-related P3 amplitudes were signiﬁcantly lower for predictable relative to unpredictable outcomes. Crucially, HEP amplitudes measured prior to feedback predicted feedback-related P3 amplitudes for anticipated outcome events. Results suggest that accurate anticipation of homeostatic feeling states associated with gain, loss or control outcomes facilitates motor execution and outcome evaluation. Findings are hereby the ﬁrst to empirically assess the link between interoceptive and motor domains and provide primary evidence for a joint processing structure.},

	abstract = {Background: There is active interest in biomarker discovery for transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). However, greater understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms is needed to identify candidate markers. Accumulating evidence suggests that taVNS inﬂuences activity in solitary and parabrachial nuclei, the primary brainstem relays for the transmission of visceral sensory afferents to the insula. The insula mediates interoception, which concerns the representation and regulation of homeostatic bodily states. Consequently, interoceptive pathways may be relevant to taVNS mechanisms of action. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that taVNS would modulate an EEG-derived marker of interoceptive processing known as the heart-evoked potential (HEP). We also hypothesized that taVNS-induced HEP effects would be localizable to the insula. Methods: Using a within-subject, sham-controlled design, we recorded EEG and ECG concurrent to taVNS in 43 healthy adults. Using ECG and EEG data, we extracted HEPs. Estimation of the cortical sources of the taVNS-dependent HEP responses observed at the scalp were computed using the Boundary Element Method and weighted Minimum Norm Estimation. Statistics were calculated using cluster-based permutation methods. Results: taVNS altered HEP amplitudes at frontocentral and centroparietal electrode sites at various latencies. The taVNS-dependent HEP effect was localized to the insula, operculum, somatosensory cortex, and orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that taVNS can access the insula as well as functionally and anatomically connected brain regions. HEPs may serve as an objective, non-invasive outcome parameter for the cortical effects of taVNS.},

However, no specific neurocognitive impairment has yet been proposed as a core deficit underlying such symptoms. We aimed to determine whether MS patients present changes in interoception—that is, the monitoring of autonomic bodily information—a process that might be related to various bodily dysfunctions. We performed two studies in 34 relapsing–remitting, early-stage MS patients and 46 controls matched for gender, age, and education. In Study 1, we evaluated the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a cortical signature of interoception, via a 128-channel EEG system during a heartbeat detection task including an exteroceptive and an interoceptive condition. Then, we obtained whole-brain MRI recordings. In Study 2, participants underwent fMRI recordings during two resting-state conditions: mind wandering and interoception. In Study 1, controls exhibited greater HEP modulation during the interoceptive condition than the exteroceptive one, but no systematic differences between conditions emerged in MS patients. Patients presented atrophy in the left insula, the posterior part of the right insula, and the right anterior cingulate cortex, with abnormal associations between neurophysiological and neuroanatomical patterns. In Study 2, controls showed higher functional connectivity and degree for the interoceptive state compared with mind wandering; however, this pattern was absent in patients, who nonetheless presented greater connectivity and degree than controls during mind wandering. MS patients were characterized by atypical multimodal brain signatures of interoception. This finding opens a new agenda to examine the role of inner-signal monitoring in the body symptomatology of MS.},

We projected a pulsing shade, that was synchronous or asynchronous with the participant’s heartbeat, onto a picture depicting the participant’s face morphed with the face of an unfamiliar other. Results revealed that synchronous (vs. asynchronous) cardio-visual stimulation led to increased self-identiﬁcation with the other’s face (Experiment 1), while during stimulation, synchronicity modulated the amplitude of the Heartbeat Evoked Potential, an electrophysiological index of cortical interoceptive processing (Experiment 2). Importantly, the magnitude of the illusion-related effects was dependent on, and increased linearly, with the participants’ Interoceptive Accuracy. These results provide the ﬁrst direct neural evidence for the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals in bodily self-awareness.},

	abstract = {Sleep is a fundamental physiological state that facilitates neural recovery during periods of attenuated sensory processing. On the other hand, mammalian sleep is also characterized by the interplay between periods of increased sleep depth and environmental alertness. Whereas the heterogeneity of microstates during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep was extensively studied in the last decades, transient microstates during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep received less attention. REM sleep features two distinct microstates: phasic and tonic. Previous studies indicate that sensory processing is largely diminished during phasic REM periods, whereas environmental alertness is partially reinstated when the brain switches into tonic REM sleep. Here, we investigated interoceptive processing as quantified by the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) during REM microstates. We contrasted the HEPs of phasic and tonic REM periods using two separate databases that included the nighttime polysomnographic recordings of healthy young individuals (N = 20 and N = 19). We find a differential HEP modulation of a late HEP component (after 500 ms post-R-peak) between tonic and phasic REM. Moreover, the late tonic HEP component resembled the HEP found in resting wakefulness. Our results indicate that interoception with respect to cardiac signals is not uniform across REM microstates, and suggest that interoceptive processing is partially reinstated during tonic REM periods. The analyses of the HEP during REM sleep may shed new light on the organization and putative function of REM microstates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interoception represents perception of the internal bodily state, which is closely associated with social/emotional processing and physical health in humans. Understanding the mechanism that underlies interoceptive processing, particularly its modulation, is therefore of great importance. Given the overlap between oxytocinergic pathways and interoceptive signaling substrates in both peripheral visceral organs and the brain, intranasal oxytocin administration is a promising approach for modulating interoceptive processing. METHODS: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-participant design, we recruited 72 healthy male participants who performed a cardiac interoceptive task during electroencephalograph and electrocardiograph recording to examine whether intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin could modulate interoceptive processing. We also collected data in a resting state to examine whether we could replicate previous ﬁndings. RESULTS: The results showed that in the interoceptive task, oxytocin increased interoceptive accuracy at the behavioral level, which was paralleled by larger heartbeat-evoked potential amplitudes in frontocentral and central regions on the neural level. However, there were no signiﬁcant effects of oxytocin on electroencephalograph or electrocardiograph during resting state. CONCLUSIONS: These ﬁndings suggest that oxytocin may only have a facilitatory effect on interoceptive processing under task-based conditions. Our ﬁndings not only provide new insights into the modulation of interoceptive processing via targeting the oxytocinergic system but also provide proof-of-concept evidence for the therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in mental disorders with dysfunctional interoception.},

A strategy to replace trial-and-error and increase remission rates could be treatment stratification. We explored the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) as a biomarker for treatment stratification to either antidepressant medication or rTMS treatment. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: (1) the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D; n = 1,008 MDD patients, randomized to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine, and n = 336 healthy controls) and (2) a multi-site, open-label rTMS study (n = 196). The primary outcome measure was remission. Cardiac field artifacts were removed from the baseline EEG using independent component analysis (ICA). The HEP-peak was detected in a bandwidth of 20 ms around 8 ms and 270 ms (N8, N270) after the R-peak of the electrocardiogram signal. Differences between remitters and non-remitters were statistically assessed by repeated-measures ANOVAs for electrodes Fp1, Cz, and Oz. Results: In the venlafaxine subgroup, remitters showed a lower HEP around the N8 peak than non-remitters on electrode site Cz (p = 0.004; d = 0.497). The rTMS group showed a non-significant difference in the opposite direction (d = −0.051). Retrospective stratification to one of the treatments based on the HEP resulted in enhanced treatment outcome prediction for venlafaxine (+22.98\%) and rTMS (+10.66\%). Conclusion: These data suggest that the HEP could be used as a stratification biomarker between venlafaxine and rTMS; however, future out-of-sample replication is warranted.},

	abstract = {Hypertensive disease (HTD), a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, is characterized by elevated stress-proneness. Since stress levels are underpinned by both cardiac and neural factors, multidimensional insights are required to robustly understand their disruption in HTD. Yet, despite their crucial relevance, heart rate variability (HRV) and multimodal neurocognitive markers of stress in HTD remain controversial and unexplored respectively. To bridge this gap, we studied cardiodynamic as well as electrophysiological and neuroanatomical measures of stress in HTD patients and healthy controls. Both groups performed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a validated stress-inducing task comprising a baseline and a mental stress period. During both stages, we assessed a sensitive HRV parameter (the low frequency/high frequency [LF/HF ratio]) and an online neurophysiological measure (the heartbeat-evoked potential [HEP]). Also, we obtained neuroanatomical data via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for correlation with online markers. Relative to controls, HTD patients exhibited increased LF/HF ratio and greater HEP modulations during baseline, reduced changes between baseline and stress periods, and lack of significant stress-related HRV modulations associated with the grey matter volume of putative frontrostriatal regions. Briefly, HTD patients presented signs of stress-related autonomic imbalance, reflected in a potential basal stress overload and a lack of responsiveness to acute psychosocial stress, accompanied by neurophysiological and neuroanatomical alterations. These multimodal insights underscore the relevance of neurocognitive data for developing innovations in the characterization, prognosis and treatment of HTD and other conditions with autonomic imbalance. More generally, these findings may offer new insights into heart-brain interactions.},

The better posttraining performance in heartbeat perception of the group receiving full-intensity feedback was also reflected in the evoked potentials. They differed markedly before and after training, especially between 250 to 400 ms (after the EKG-R-wave), the biggest effect being at Fz and F7.

The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) marker of interoceptive processing. Aim To assess whether alterations in interoceptive processing indexed by HEP occur prior to FS and compare this with epileptic seizures (ES). Methods HEP amplitudes were calculated from EEG during video-EEG monitoring in 25 patients with FS and 19 patients with ES, and were compared between interictal and preictal states. HEP amplitude difference was calculated as preictal HEP amplitude minus interictal HEP amplitude. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HEP amplitude difference in discriminating FS from ES. Results The FS group demonstrated a significant reduction in HEP amplitude between interictal and preictal states at F8 (effect size rB=0.612, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected q=0.030) and C4 (rB=0.600, FDR-corrected q=0.035). No differences in HEP amplitude were found between states in the ES group. Between diagnostic groups, HEP amplitude difference differed between the FS and ES groups at F8 (rB=0.423, FDR-corrected q=0.085) and C4 (rB=0.457, FDR-corrected q=0.085). Using HEP amplitude difference at frontal and central electrodes plus sex, we found that the ROC curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.893, with sensitivity=0.840 and specificity=0.842. Conclusion Our data support the notion that aberrant interoception occurs prior to FS. Changes in HEP amplitude may reflect a neurophysiological biomarker of FS and may have diagnostic utility in differentiating FS and ES.},

	abstract = {Joint ECG and EEG measurements were performed in 22 healthy subjects under standardized laboratory conditions. Averaged EEG potentials were computed using the R-peaks in the ECG as reference events. Spatio-temporal potential patterns of heart action-related EEG activity were obtained from 26 scalp channels. A heart action-related positive potential was found, peaking over the parietal scalp regions. Its independence from the cardiac electrical ﬁeld, the source of an EEG artifact that may be confounded with heart action-related brain potentials, is demonstrated. The potential reaches its maximum amplitude of about 0.5 mV at a latency of about 500 ms after the R-peak. Its topography, with peak amplitudes at the parietal electrode locations, is different from the topography of potentials observed in the few comparable experimental studies published so far. This suggests the presence of somatosensory-evoked components in heart action-related potentials and indicates that a renewed discussion of the underlying neuronal processes is necessary.  1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},
