	abstract = {Our brain continuously receives signals from the body and the environment. Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they can affect our perception. Here, we show two distinct ways in which the heartbeat modulates conscious perception. First, increased heartbeat-evoked neural activity before stimulation is followed by decreased somatosensory detection. This effect can be explained by subjects adopting a more conservative decision criterion, which is accompanied by changes in early and late somatosensory-evoked responses. Second, stimulus timing during the cardiac cycle affects sensitivity but not criterion for somatosensory stimuli, which is reflected only in late somatosensory-evoked responses. We propose that these heartbeat-related modulations are connected to fluctuations of interoceptive attention and (unconscious) predictive coding mechanisms.

Even though humans are mostly not aware of their heartbeats, several heartbeat-related effects have been reported to influence conscious perception. It is not clear whether these effects are distinct or related phenomena, or whether they are early sensory effects or late decisional processes. Combining electroencephalography and electrocardiography, along with signal detection theory analyses, we identify two distinct heartbeat-related influences on conscious perception differentially related to early vs. late somatosensory processing. First, an effect on early sensory processing was found for the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a marker of cardiac interoception. The amplitude of the prestimulus HEP negatively correlated with localization and detection of somatosensory stimuli, reflecting a more conservative detection bias (criterion). Importantly, higher HEP amplitudes were followed by decreases in early (P50) as well as late (N140, P300) somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes. Second, stimulus timing along the cardiac cycle also affected perception. During systole, stimuli were detected and correctly localized less frequently, relating to a shift in perceptual sensitivity. This perceptual attenuation was accompanied by the suppression of only late SEP components (P300) and was stronger for individuals with a more stable heart rate. Both heart-related effects were independent of alpha oscillations’ influence on somatosensory processing. We explain cardiac cycle timing effects in a predictive coding account and suggest that HEP-related effects might reflect spontaneous shifts between interoception and exteroception or modulations of general attentional resources. Thus, our results provide a general conceptual framework to explain how internal signals can be integrated into our conscious perception of the world.},

	abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, minimally restrictive, and relatively low-cost measure of mesoscale brain dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many different sources, biological and non-biological, independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various source generator processes underlying those recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic interpretations and therefore require further study of their properties. Alternatively, sufﬁciently-accurate automated IC classiﬁers can be used to classify ICs into broad source categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in near-realtime applications. While many such classiﬁers have been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6000 EEG recordings and matching component labels for over 6000 of those ICs, all using common average reference, (2) the ICLabel website for collecting crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated ICLabel classiﬁer, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel classiﬁer improves upon existing methods in two ways: by improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational efﬁciency. The classiﬁer outperforms or performs comparably to the previous best publicly available automated IC component classiﬁcation method for all measured IC categories while computing those labels ten times faster than that classiﬁer as shown by a systematic comparison against other publicly available EEG IC classiﬁers.},

The richness of these datasets can be very useful in testing sophisticated hypotheses, but this richness also creates many opportunities to obtain effects that are statistically significant but do not reflect true differences among groups or conditions (bogus effects). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how common and seemingly innocuous methods for quantifying and analyzing ERP effects can lead to very high rates of significant but bogus effects, with the likelihood of obtaining at least one such bogus effect exceeding 50\% in many experiments. We focus on two specific problems: using the grand-averaged data to select the time windows and electrode sites for quantifying component amplitudes and latencies, and using one or more multifactor statistical analyses. Reanalyses of prior data and simulations of typical experimental designs are used to show how these problems can greatly increase the likelihood of significant but bogus results. Several strategies are described for avoiding these problems and for increasing the likelihood that significant effects actually reflect true differences among groups or conditions.},

Although tangible improvements have been made in academic publishing and conference participation, gender imbalances in citations among leading neuroscience journals persist and are increasing with time. Here, we expand upon prior work by providing a more comprehensive analysis of citation practices across fifty journals to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the field as a whole, particularly across different kinds of journals. We first confirm that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than expected if gender were unrelated to citation practices. Further, we demonstrate that this effect is strongest in the most influential journals. We also find that the apparent closure of the gender gap is due to the interaction of three unique, nuanced patterns of citation: one that is characterized by relative overcitation of papers with men as both first and last author; one that is characterized by relative overcitation of women as the last author, and one that is characterized by relative undercitation of women as the first author. In addition, we find that these patterns of citation are not distributed evenly across the field: more prestigious journals tend to have articles with citation gaps favoring men, while less prestigious journals tend to overcite papers with women as last authors. We discuss potential drivers for these patterns and suggest some implications for the field moving forward.},

	abstract = {Central nervous systems receive and process information from the internal and external environment to maintain homeostasis. This includes interoceptive awareness of the organism’s nutritional state. Whenever food supply is required, feelings of hunger initiate the search for and the consumption of appropriate amounts of nutrients. How this is physiologically regulated in humans has been subjected to research into interoceptive awareness of body states during fasting and food consumption. However, there is no research on the distinct effects of carbohydrate or protein intake on interoception. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of fasting and consumption of standardized carbohydrate and protein shakes on interoception in a repeatedmeasures cross-over design in a sample of 37 healthy, normal weight males. As a physiological correlate of interoception, we measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), which are suggested to reﬂect the cortical representation of cardiac signals, during eight-minutes resting state EEG-recordings. After a 16-hour fasting period, the HEP amplitudes were lower over right central and parietal electrodes and increased after ingestion of the nutritional shake. Exploratory analyses indicated that the difference between fasting and satiety was more prominent at carbohydrate compared protein testing days. Correlation analyses with heart rate variability (HRV) suggested that high cardiac sympathetic activity is related to lower HEP amplitudes. Furthermore, cardiac sympathetic activity and stress indices decreased from before to after the intervention, whereas HRV increased. Together, this study shows for the ﬁrst time that fasting and the intake of a nutritional shake affects cardiac measures of autonomic nervous system functioning and the neural correlates of cardiac interoception. These ﬁndings could be relevant for diets and psychosomatic disorders, including eating disorders.},

The hypothesis is presented that most of the electric current coupled to the cardiac field surrounds the skull and flows through the scalp tissue without crossing the cranial cavity. This pseudo two-dimensional conduction model contrasts with the volumetric conduction of the brain electrical activity, and this property is exploited to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. QRS loop vectorcardiographic projections on saggital planes were recorded in 11 healthy subjects in the head and neck areas. Comparative analysis of the projection eccentricities, estimated by the correlation coefficients of the paired data on each area, supported the hypothesis and allowed the handling of the cardiac electric field at the scalp as if enclosed in a two-dimensional wrapped space. This approach permitted the combination of different heart action-related brain potentials recorded at different electrode positions to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. The cancellation method, applied to the subjects" EEG data, yielded a slow cortical potential with a negligible cardiac electric residue and an amplitude of about 1.5-2 ixV, with a m a x i m u m around 150 ms and a minimum at 400 ms post-R wave.},

When heart cycle-related EEG averaging is performed, e.g. in order to measure heart cyclerelated brain potentials, the effects of the cardiac electrical field result in a high-amplitude artifact in the surface potentials. The topographic and temporal distributions of the cardiac field artifact were measured in 9 normal subjects. In addition, the effects of head-turning on the field were investigated. The electrocardiac artifact is most prominent during the QRS complex and during the T wave of the heart cycle. In both cases it is distinctly asymmetrical in relation to the hemispheres. A comparison of the scalp potentials and a computed vector ECG showed the 3-dimensional nature of the artifact. Non-computational strategies for the handling of the ECG artifact are discussed. A proper separation of the effects of the cardiac electrical field from heart cycle-related brain potentials is a prerequisite for the study of heart cycle-coordinated brain potentials. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Previous work exploring the interplay between the processing of internal bodily signals and the perception of external events suggests a correlative relationship between both domains. Here, we demonstrate an experimentally induced link between visual perception and the emotional modulation of interoceptive cardiac signals. We pair an emotion repetition-suppression paradigm shown to modulate neural responses to heartbeats with a previously reported visual detection task. Using electrophysiological and cardiac measurements, we show that, relative to alternating facial expressions of emotions, repeating facial expressions evoke stable patterns of cardiac responses and that this iteration of the cardiac response leads to a distinct modulation of the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitude. Crucially, we were able to modulate the direction of the amplitude change to increase HEP expression in response to repeated emotionally neutral faces and decrease it by repeating angry faces. Visual detection accuracy was significantly higher in repeating, relative to alternating face trials. Furthermore, reduced HEP amplitude to repeated angry faces acted as a direct predictor of subsequently elevated detection performance. Our findings demonstrate that accurate top-down anticipation of the heartbeat signal coincides with enhanced exteroceptive visual perception, particularly in the context of emotional events. Findings hereby highlight the integrated nature of internal and external stimulus processing and implicate predictive interoceptive processes induced by emotions for the conscious perception of sensory input activated from outside of the body.},

This study tested three assumptions of the perception-filter model contributing to MUS: (I.) increased bodily signal strength (II.) decreased filter function, (III.) increased perception. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, trait MUS were assessed by a web-based survey (N = 486). The upper and lower decile were identified as extreme groups of high (HSR; n = 29; 26 women; Mage = 26.0 years) and low symptom reporters (LSR; n = 29; 21 women; Mage = 28.4 years). Mean heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), and cortisol awakening response (CAR) were assessed as indicators of bodily signal strength (I.). Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) were assessed during rest and a heartbeat perception task. HEPs reflect attentional resources allocated towards heartbeats and served as index of filter function (II.). Interoceptive accuracy (IAc) in heartbeat perception was assessed as an indicator of perception (III.). Results: HSR showed higher HR and lower HRV (RMSSD) than LSR (I.), but no differences in CAR. HSR exhibited a stronger increase of HEPs when attention was focused on heartbeats than LSR (II.); there were no group differences in IAc (III.). Conclusions: The perception-filter model was partially confirmed in that HSR showed altered bodily signals suggesting higher sympathetic activity (I.); higher HEP increases indicated increased filter function for bodily signals (II.). As more attentional resources are mobilized to process heartbeats, but perception accuracy remains unchanged (III.), this overflow could be responsible for detecting minor bodily changes associated with MUS.},

However, it remains unclear whether repetitive engagement in physical exercise over time leads to long-term changes in cardiac interoceptive accuracy. It is also unknown whether those changes affect the neural activity associated with the processing of afferent cardiac signals, assessed by the heartevoked potential (HEP). In this study, we aimed to investigate this hypothesis through two cross-sectional studies, categorizing participants as active or inactive based on physical fitness (Study I; N = 45) or selfreported physical activity levels (Study II; N = 60). Interoception was assessed at rest using the HEP (Studies I and II), the Heartbeat Counting task (Study II), and the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) (Study II). Study I showed strong evidence of better cardiovascular fitness in the active group than in the inactive group as well as robust between-group differences in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Study 2 replicated the clear differences in ECG as a function of regular physical activity. Those results were expected due to clear differences in physical activity habits. In contrast, our analysis revealed no robust differences between groups across cardiac interoception tasks and the RHI, although the direct relevance of these measures to interoception remains under investigation. In sum, our results do not provide convincing evidence to support a strong version of the notion that regular physical exercise is associated with an enhanced in cardiac interoception.},

Here we investigate whether the cardiac cycle relates to learning-related internal representations – absolute and signed prediction errors. We combined machine learning techniques with electroencephalography with both simple, direct indices of task performance and computational model-derived indices of learning. Our results demonstrate that just as people are more sensitive to low magnitude, near-threshold sensory stimuli in certain cardiac phases, so are they more sensitive to low magnitude absolute prediction errors in the same cycles. However, this occurs even when the low magnitude prediction errors are associated with clearly suprathreshold sensory events. In addition, participants exhibiting stronger differences in their prediction error representations between cardiac cycles exhibited higher learning rates and greater task accuracy.},

Clinical data suggest that cortisol may lower the threshold for interoceptive stimuli, while a pharmacological administration of cortisol decreases the sensitivity for physical symptoms. To clarify the role of cortisol for the processing of interoceptive signals, we investigated 16 healthy men on two occasions, once during the infusion of 4 mg of cortisol and once during the infusion of a placebo substance. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP; derived from resting EEG and ECG, during open and closed eyes), which are psychophysiological indicators for the cortical processing of cardioceptive signals, were measured over 6-min periods once before, and four times after the infusion (1—7, 11—17, 21—27 and 31—37 min). We found that HEP amplitudes were higher during open than during closed eyes between 1 and 17 min after cortisol infusion. There was no effect of cortisol on heart rate. We conclude that cortisol may rapidly modulate the cortical processing of cardioceptive neural signals. These results may have relevance for the effects of stress on the development and maintenance of psychosomatic symptoms. \# 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies showed that the visceral information is constantly processed by the brain, thereby potentially influencing cognition. One index of such process is the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an ERP component related to the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP is sensitive to a number of factors such as motivation, attention, pain, which are associated with higher levels of arousal. However, the role of arousal and its associated brain oscillations on the HEP has not been characterized, yet it could underlie the previous findings. Here we analysed the effects of high- (HA) and low-arousal (LA) induction on the HEP. Further, we investigated the brain oscillations and their role in the HEP in response to HA and LA inductions. As compared to LA, HA was associated with a higher HEP and lower alpha oscillations. Interestingly, individual differences in the HEP modulation by arousal induction were correlated with alpha oscillations. In particular, participants with higher alpha power during the arousal inductions showed a larger HEP in response to HA compared to LA. In summary, we demonstrated that arousal induction affects the cortical processing of heartbeats; and that the alpha oscillations may modulate this effect.},

	abstract = {Background: The choice of EEG reference has been widely studied. However, the choice of the most appropriate re-referencing for EEG data is still debated. Moreover, the role of EEG reference in the estimation of functional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI), together with different multivariate modelling strategies, has not been investigated yet. Methods: This study identifies the best methodology combining a proper EEG electrical reference and signal processing methods for an effective functional BHI assessment. The effects of the EEG reference among common average, mastoids average, Laplacian reference, Cz reference, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) were explored throughout different BHI methods including synthetic data generation (SDG) model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient. Results: The SDG model exhibited high robustness between EEG references, whereas the maximal information coefficient method exhibited a high sensitivity. The common average and REST references for EEG showed a good consistency in the between-method comparisons. Laplacian, and Cz references significantly bias a BHI measurement. Comparison with existing methods: The use of EEG reference based on a common average outperforms on the use of other references for consistency in estimating directed functional BHI. We do not recommend the use of EEG references based on analytical derivations as the experimental conditions may not meet the requirements of their optimal estimation, particularly in clinical settings. Conclusion: The use of a common average for EEG electrical reference is concluded to be the most appropriate choice for a quantitative, functional BHI assessment.},

EEG, EOG, and ECG were recorded while participants attended to their heartbeats. The R-wave of the ECG served as a trigger for EEG averaging. In the latency range of 250–350 ms after the ECG R-wave, the HEP amplitude at the right central location was signiﬁcantly higher in good heartbeat perceivers. A signiﬁcantly positive correlation was observed between the heartbeat perception score and the mean HEP amplitude.

	abstract = {Emotional trauma and psychological stress can precipitate cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death through arrhythmogenic effects of efferent sympathetic drive. Patients with preexisting heart disease are particularly at risk. Moreover, generation of proarrhythmic activity patterns within cerebral autonomic centers may be amplified by afferent feedback from a dysfunctional myocardium. An electrocortical potential reflecting afferent cardiac information has been described, reflecting individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity (awareness of one's own heartbeats). To inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis, we extended this approach, identifying electrocortical potentials corresponding to the cortical expression of afferent information about the integrity of myocardial function during stress. We measured changes in cardiac response simultaneously with electroencephalography in patients with established ventricular dysfunction. Experimentally induced mental stress enhanced cardiovascular indices of sympathetic activity (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, ventricular ejection fraction, and skin conductance) across all patients. However, the functional response of the myocardium varied; some patients increased, whereas others decreased, cardiac output during stress. Across patients, heartbeat-evoked potential amplitude at left temporal and lateral frontal electrode locations correlated with stress-induced changes in cardiac output, consistent with an afferent cortical representation of myocardial function during stress. Moreover, the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in the left temporal region reflected the proarrhythmic status of the heart (inhomogeneity of left ventricular repolarization). These observations delineate a cortical representation of cardiac function predictive of proarrhythmic abnormalities in cardiac repolarization. Our findings highlight the dynamic interaction of heart and brain in stress-induced cardiovascular morbidity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study performed at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs), an indicator of the cortical representation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, were investigated in 34 medication-free patients with BPD, 31 healthy volunteers, and 17 medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms, history of childhood traumatization, and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of disturbed body awareness, high-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest–based approaches. The study was performed between 2012 and 2014, and data analysis was performed in 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional dysregulation, as well as with gray matter volume. RESULTS Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes compared with healthy volunteers (F1,61 = 11.32, P = .001), whereas the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere in between these 2 groups of participants (P {\textbackslash}textgreater .05). The HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = −0.30, P = .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (R = 0.53, P {\textbackslash}textless .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (R = 0.47, P {\textbackslash}textless .05), 2 structures that have been identified as core regions for interoception. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results indicate state-dependent deficits in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD, which appear to be associated with core features of BPD. The analysis of patients with BPD in remission suggests an improvement in cortical representation of bodily signals with symptom remission. Results recommend the integration of techniques to strengthen bodily awareness in psychotherapeutic interventions of BPD.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience difficulties in emotional awareness (alexithymia), and often develop dissociative symptoms, which may reflect broader deficits in interoceptive awareness. Whether this is associated with alterations in cortical processing of interoception is currently unknown. Methods: We utilized an electrophysiological marker of interoception, i.e. heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP), and examined its relationship with electrocardiographic correlates of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning (heart rate variability), and with self-report measures of alexithymia, dissociation and borderline symptom severity in patients with BPD. Results: Individuals with BPD had higher HEP amplitudes over frontal electrodes compared to healthy controls. Sympathetic ANS activity was greater in BPD patients than in controls. Across groups, HEP amplitudes were associated with parasympathetic activity over central electrodes and correlated with alexithymia over frontal electrodes. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that difficulties in emotional awareness in BPD are reflected in altered frontal electrophysiological markers of interception. Therefore, emotional awareness can be understood as failures of modulation between interoceptive and exteroceptive attention. Future research may aim to investigate whether altered interoception and its electrophysiological correlates are malleable by therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Emotional dysregulation, a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has recently been linked to deficits in the cortical representation of bodily signals. Oxytocin modulates the salience of external social cues. However, its role in interoception is still not fully understood. The aim of the current study was to replicate reduced heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) as a marker for the cortical representation of cardiac signals in BPD and to explore potential effects of oxytocin on HEP amplitude. Methods: Fifty-three medication-free women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and sixty healthy female controls (HCs) participated in the study. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, participants self-administered either 24 I.U. of oxytocin or placebo and took part in a 5-minute resting-state electrocardiogram (ECG) with parallel electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement. In addition, emotional dysregulation and BPD symptomatology were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Results: Patients with BPD had significantly lower mean HEP amplitudes than HCs. Furthermore, HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation in the whole sample. However, oxytocin had no significant effect on HEP amplitude. Limitations: Only female participants were investigated and no clinicial controls were included. Conclusions: This is the first replication from an independent sample showing a reduced cortical representation of cardiac signals in BPD patients. This, together with other body-related symptoms, suggests deficits in the processing of bodily signals, which seem to be associated with emotional dysregulation. Whether oxytocin influences HEP during emotion regulation tasks needs to be investigated in future studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Early life maltreatment is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe and heterogeneous disorder with fluctuating states of emotional over- and undermodulation, including hypervigilance, dissociation, and emotion regulation deficits. The perception and regulation of emotions have been linked to interoception, the cortical representation and sensing of inner bodily processes. Although first therapeutic approaches targeting bodily sensations have been found effective in patients with PTSD, and deficits in interoceptive signal representation have been reported in other trauma-related disorders, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), the role of interoception remains largely unexplored for PTSD. Objective: The objective was to investigate the cortical representation of cardiac interoceptive signals in patients with PTSD and its associations with early life maltreatment, trait dissociation, and emotion dysregulation. Methods: Twenty-four medication-free patients with PTSD and 31 healthy controls (HC) completed a 5-min resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with parallel electroencephalogram (EEG). Heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes as a measure for cortical representation of cardiac interoceptive signals were compared between groups and correlated with selfreport questionnaires. Results: We did not find significantly different mean HEP amplitudes in patients with PTSD compared to HC, although HEPs of patients with PTSD were descriptively higher. No significant associations between mean HEP amplitudes and early life maltreatment, trait dissociation or emotion dysregulation were obtained within the groups. Conclusion: The current finding does not indicate deficits in interoceptive signal representation at rest in individuals with PTSD. Whether patients with PTSD show altered HEP modulations during emotion regulation tasks and might benefit from therapeutic approaches aiming at changing the perception of bodily signals, needs to be investigated in future studies.},

	abstract = {The heart and brain are reciprocally interconnected and engage in two-way communication for homeostatic regulation. Epilepsy is considered a network disease that also affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The neurovisceral integration model (NVM) proposes that cardiac vagal tone, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), can indicate the functional integrity of cognitive neural networks. ANS activity and the pattern of oscillatory EEG activity covary during the transition of arousal states and associations between cortical and autonomic activity are reflected by HRV. Cognitive dysfunction is one of the common comorbidities that occur in epilepsy, including memory, attention, and processing difficulties. Recent studies have shown evidence for the active involvement of alpha activity in cognitive processes through its active role in the control of neural excitability in the cortex through top-down modulation of cortical networks. In the present pilot study, we evaluated the association between resting EEG oscillatory behavior and ANS function in patients with refractory epilepsy. Our results show: (1) In patients with refractory epilepsy, there is a strong positive correlation between HRV and the power of cortical oscillatory cortical activity in all studied EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) in all regions of interest in both hemispheres, the opposite pattern found in controls which had low or negative correlation between these variables; (2) higher heartbeat evoked potential amplitudes in patients with refractory epilepsy than in controls. Taken together, these results point to a significant alteration in heart-brain interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy.},

In non-emotional cognition, the transient neural response evoked at each heartbeat, or heartbeat evoked response (HER), indexes the self and signals Self/Other distinction. Here, using electroencephalography (n = 32), we probe whether HERs’ role in Self/Other distinction extends also to emotion – a domain where brain-body interactions are particularly relevant. We asked participants to rate independently validated aﬀective scenes, reporting either their own emotion (Self) or the emotion expressed by people in the scene (Other). During the visual cue indicating to adopt the Self or Other perspective, before the aﬀective scene, HERs distinguished between the two conditions, in visual cortices as well as in the right frontal operculum. Physiological reactivity (facial electromyogram, skin conductance, heart rate) during aﬀective scene co-varied as expected with valence and arousal ratings, but also with the Self- or Other- perspective adopted. Finally, HERs contributed to the subjective experience of valence in the Self condition, in addition to and independently from physiological reactivity. We thus show that HERs represent a trans-domain marker of Self/Other distinction, here speciﬁcally contributing to experienced valence. We propose that HERs represent a form of evidence related to the ‘I’ part of the judgement ‘To which extent do I feel happy’. The ‘I’ related evidence would be combined with the aﬀective evidence collected during aﬀective scene presentation, accounting at least partly for the diﬀerence between feeling an emotion and identifying it in someone else.},

	abstract = {Background: Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) is usually obtained to assess seizures in comatose patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aim to investigate rsEEG measures and their prediction of early recovery of consciousness in patients with TBI. Methods: This is a retrospective study of comatose patients with TBI who were admitted to a trauma center (October 2013 to January 2022). Demographics, basic clinical data, imaging characteristics, and EEGs were collected. We calculated the following using 10-min rsEEGs: power spectral density, permutation entropy (complexity measure), weighted symbolic mutual information (wSMI, global information sharing measure), Kolmogorov complexity (Kolcom, complexity measure), and heart-evoked potentials (the averaged EEG signal relative to the corresponding QRS complex on electrocardiography). We evaluated the prediction of consciousness recovery before hospital discharge using clinical, imaging, and rsEEG data via a support vector machine. Results: We studied 113 of 134 (84\%) patients with rsEEGs. A total of 73 (65\%) patients recovered consciousness before discharge. Patients who recovered consciousness were younger (40 vs. 50 years, p = 0.01). Patients who recovered also had higher Kolcom (U = 1688, p = 0.01), increased beta power (U = 1,652 p = 0.003) with higher variability across channels (U = 1534, p = 0.034) and epochs (U = 1711, p = 0.004), lower delta power (U = 981, p = 0.04), and higher connectivity across time and channels as measured by wSMI in the theta band (U = 1636, p = 0.026; U = 1639, p = 0.024) than those who did not recover. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for rsEEG was higher than that for clinical data (using age, motor response, pupil reactivity) and higher than that for the Marshall computed tomography classification (0.69 vs. 0.66 vs. 0.56, respectively; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Conclusions: We describe the rsEEG signature in recovery of consciousness prior to discharge in comatose patients with TBI. rsEEG measures performed modestly better than the clinical and imaging data in predicting recovery.},

	abstract = {Objective: A deficit in interoception ‐ the ability to perceive, interpret and integrate afferent signals about the physiological state of the body ‐ has been shown in Anorexia Nervosa (AN), and linked to altered hunger sensations, body dysmorphia, and abnormal emotional awareness. The present high‐density electroencephalography (hdEEG) study aims to assess cardiac interoception in AN and to investigate its neural correlates, using an objective neurophysiological measure. Method: Heartbeat‐evoked potentials (HEPs) were computed from 5 min of resting‐state EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) data and compared between individuals with AN (N = 22) and healthy controls (HC) (N = 19) with waveform, topographic, and source imaging analyses. Results: Differences in the cortical representation of heartbeats were present between AN and HC at a time window of 332–348 ms after the ECG R‐peak. Source imaging analyses revealed a right‐sided hypoactivation in AN of brain regions linked to interoceptive processing, such as the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal areas. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using hdEEG to localise the underlying sources of HEPs in AN. Results point to altered interoceptive processing during resting‐state in AN. As our participants had a short duration of illness, this might not be the consequence of prolonged starvation. Interventions targeted at interoception could provide an additional tool to facilitate recovery.},

	abstract = {Introduction Dissociative seizures often occur in the context of dysregulated affective arousal and entail dissociative symptoms such as a disintegration of bodily awareness. However, the interplay between affective arousal and changes in interoceptive processing at the onset of dissociative seizures is not well understood. Methods Using retrospective routine data obtained from video-electroencephalography telemetry in a university hospital epilepsy monitoring unit, we investigate ictal changes in cardiac indices of autonomic arousal and heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs) in 24 patients with dissociative seizures. Results Results show autonomic arousal during seizures with increased heart rate and a shift towards sympathetic activity. Compared with baseline, ictal HEP amplitudes over central and right prefrontal electrodes (F8, Fz) were significantly less pronounced during seizures, suggesting diminished cortical representation of interoceptive information. Significant correlations between heart rate variability measures and HEPs were observed at baseline, with more sympathetic and less parasympathetic activity related to less pronounced HEPs. Interestingly, these relationships weakened during seizures, suggesting a disintegration of autonomic arousal and interoceptive processing during dissociative seizures. In a subgroup of 16 patients, MRI-based cortical thickness analysis found a correlation with HEP amplitudes in the left somatosensory association cortex. Conclusions These findings possibly represent an electrophysiological hint of how autonomic arousal could negatively impact bodily awareness in dissociative seizures, and how these processes might be related to underlying brain structure.},

Our aim was to investigate interoceptive processing in highs, lows, and medium hypnotizable individuals (mediums), who represent most of the population, during a 10-minute open eyes relaxation condition (Part 1) and three repetitions of consecutive 2-minute open eyes, closed eyes, and heartbeat counting conditions, followed by a 2-minute post-counting condition (Part 2). Electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram were recorded in 14 highs, 14 mediums, and 18 lows, classified according to the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. Heartbeat-evoked cortical potentials (HEP) were extracted throughout the entire session, and IA index was obtained for the heartbeat counting task (HCT). In Part 1, significant hypnotizability-related differences were observed in the right central region in both early and late HEP components, with lows showing positive amplitudes and highs/mediums showing negative amplitudes. In Part 2, the same group differences were limited to the early component. Moreover, in the left frontal regions, only mediums modified their HEP during the counting task with respect to the open/ closed eyes conditions, whereas highs displayed HEP differences between counting and post-counting rest. HCT did not show significant group differences. In conclusion, highs and mediums seem to be more similar than mediums and lows regarding HEP, despite the absence of significant differences in HCT. Nonetheless, a negative correlation between hypnotizability scores and HEP amplitudes was observed in the regions showing group differences.},

The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is an EEG ﬂuctuation reﬂecting the cortical processing of cardiac signals. We recently found higher HEP amplitude during exhalation than inhalation during a task involving attention to cardiac sensations. This may have been due to reduced cardiac perception during inhalation and heightened perception during exhalation through attentional mechanisms. To investigate relationships between HEP, attention, and respiration, we introduced an experimental setup that included tasks related to cardiac and respiratory interoceptive and exteroceptive attention. Results revealed HEP amplitude increases during the interoceptive tasks over fronto-central electrodes. When respiratory phases were taken into account, HEP increases were primarily driven by heartbeats recorded during exhalation, speciﬁcally during the cardiac interoceptive task, while inhalation had minimal impact. These ﬁndings emphasize the role of respiration in cardiac interoceptive attention and could have implications for respiratory interventions to ﬁne-tune cardiac interoception.},

	abstract = {Several theories propose that emotions and self-awareness arise from the integration of internal and external signals and their respective precision-weighted expectations. Supporting these mechanisms, research indicates that the brain uses temporal cues from cardiac signals to predict auditory stimuli and that these predictions and their prediction errors can be observed in the scalp heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP). We investigated the effect of precision modulations on these cross-modal predictive mechanisms, via attention and interoceptive ability. We presented auditory sequences at short (perceived synchronous) or long (perceived asynchronous) cardio-audio delays, with half of the trials including an omission. Participants attended to the cardio-audio synchronicity of the tones (internal attention) or the auditory stimuli alone (external attention). Comparing HEPs during omissions allowed for the observation of pure predictive signals, without contaminating auditory input. We observed an early effect of cardio-audio delay, ref lecting a difference in heartbeat-driven expectations. We also observed a larger positivity to the omissions of sounds perceived as synchronous than to the omissions of sounds perceived as asynchronous when attending internally only, consistent with the role of attentional precision for enhancing predictions. These results provide support for attentionally modulated cross-modal predictive coding and suggest a potential tool for investigating its role in emotion and self-awareness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The predictive coding theory of allostatic-interoceptive load states that brain networks mediating autonomic regulation and interoceptive-exteroceptive balance regulate the internal milieu to anticipate future needs and environmental demands. These functions seem to be distinctly compromised in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), including alterations of the allostatic-interoceptive network (AIN). Here, we hypothesize that bvFTD is typiﬁed by an allostatic-interoceptive overload. METHODS: We assessed resting-state heartbeat evoked potential (rsHEP) modulation as well as its behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging correlates in patients with bvFTD relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (N = 94). We measured 1) resting-state electroencephalography (to assess the rsHEP, prompted by visceral inputs and modulated by internal body sensing), 2) associations between rsHEP and its neural generators (source location), 3) cognitive disturbances (cognitive state, executive functions, facial emotion recognition), 4) brain atrophy, and 5) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (AIN vs. control networks). RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease, patients with bvFTD presented more negative rsHEP amplitudes with sources in critical hubs of the AIN (insula, amygdala, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex). This exacerbated rsHEP modulation selectively predicted the patients’ cognitive proﬁle (including cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and emotional impairments). In addition, increased rsHEP modulation in bvFTD was associated with decreased brain volume and connectivity of the AIN. Machine learning results conﬁrmed AIN speciﬁcity in predicting the bvFTD group. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results suggest that bvFTD may be characterized by an allostatic-interoceptive overload manifested in ongoing electrophysiological markers, brain atrophy, functional networks, and cognition.},

We observed that HER co-fluctuates with stroke volume on a beat-to-beat basis, but only when no correction for cardiac artifact was performed. This highlights the importance of an ICA correction tailored to the cardiac artifact. We also observed that easy-to-measure cardiac parameters (interbeat intervals, ECG amplitude) are sensitive to stroke volume fluctuations and can be used as proxies when stroke volume measurements are not available. Finally, interindividual differences in stroke volume were reflected in MEG data, but whether this effect is locked to heartbeats is unclear.

	abstract = {Background Patients with functional seizures (FS) can experience dissociation (depersonalisation) before their seizures. Depersonalisation reflects disembodiment, which may be related to changes in interoceptive processing. The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) marker of interoceptive processing. Aim To assess whether alterations in interoceptive processing indexed by HEP occur prior to FS and compare this with epileptic seizures (ES). Methods HEP amplitudes were calculated from EEG during video-EEG monitoring in 25 patients with FS and 19 patients with ES, and were compared between interictal and preictal states. HEP amplitude difference was calculated as preictal HEP amplitude minus interictal HEP amplitude. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HEP amplitude difference in discriminating FS from ES. Results The FS group demonstrated a significant reduction in HEP amplitude between interictal and preictal states at F8 (effect size rB=0.612, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected q=0.030) and C4 (rB=0.600, FDR-corrected q=0.035). No differences in HEP amplitude were found between states in the ES group. Between diagnostic groups, HEP amplitude difference differed between the FS and ES groups at F8 (rB=0.423, FDR-corrected q=0.085) and C4 (rB=0.457, FDR-corrected q=0.085). Using HEP amplitude difference at frontal and central electrodes plus sex, we found that the ROC curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.893, with sensitivity=0.840 and specificity=0.842. Conclusion Our data support the notion that aberrant interoception occurs prior to FS. Changes in HEP amplitude may reflect a neurophysiological biomarker of FS and may have diagnostic utility in differentiating FS and ES.},
