Note, since it is a systematic review:<br>
We analysed the reviewed body of literature (here, 132 included HEP studies; —> folder reviewed_body) as well as our own citation behaviour in the manuscript or main text (—> folder own_citation_behaviour). This is because not all reviewed studies were referenced in the main text, and because the main text includes other references (not reviewed).

We conducted further analyses on the body of reviewed HER research (as outlined under section *Statement and gender composition within HER research and citation diversity* of the main text, as well as in *Supplementary Section D*). The analyses can be tracked in the knitted .Rmd file: **enk_further_citationdiversitytracking.html**. The code was last updated (to add documentation) on 11 August 2025.
