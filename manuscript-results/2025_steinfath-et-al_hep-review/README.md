Note, since it is a systematic review:
We analysed the reviewed body of literature (here, 132 included HEP studies; —> folder reviewed_body) as well as our own citation behaviour in the manuscript or main text (—> folder own_citation_behaviour). This is because not all reviewed studies were referenced in the main text, and because the main text includes other references (not reviewed).
