Note, this is a **Systematic Review**. For that reason, we analysed the reviewed body of literature (here, 132 included HER studies â€”> **ReviewLit/**) as well as our own citation behaviour in the manuscript or main text (â€”> **OwnCitationBehav/**). This is because not all reviewed studies were referenced in the main text, and because - naturally - the main text includes additional references.

We conducted further analyses on the body of reviewed HER research (as outlined under section *Statement and gender composition within HER research and citation diversity* of the main text, as well as in *Supplementary Section D*). The analyses (code,results) can be tracked in the knitted .Rmd file ðŸŸ¢ **enk_further_citationdiversitytracking.html**. The code was last updated on 11 August 2025 to add documentation.
